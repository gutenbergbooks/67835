</div>

<p class='c006'>“Chicago,” said Professor John Thornton, “Chicago,
my dear doctor, is the typical American city.
New York and San Francisco may be classed as metropolitan.
Philadelphia, St. Louis, and New Orleans
are local to their surroundings; Boston is—Boston, but
Chicago is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</span></i>. Notwithstanding its large
permanent foreign population, and the presence of the
throngs of strangers attracted by the Columbian Exposition,
Chicago remains intensely and distinctively
an American city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I quite believe you, professor,” said Dr. Eustace.
“Certainly in all the world elsewhere there is no race
track for locomotives, no place where iron horses are
speeded, and purses of gold and diamond badges
awarded to the winners.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is an innovation certainly, doctor, but just such
a one as might have been expected in Chicago. The
people of this city have not yet passed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse
oblige</span></i> period. You know that in all large cities there
is liable to come a time when the citizens divide into
separate communities, usually with separate interests,
and without any general public spirit. In New York,
for instance, Madison Square takes no pride in the
East River bridge, Avenue A does not care whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the Grant monument shall ever be completed, and the
Statue of Liberty on Bedloe’s Island is as strange to
many a resident of Harlem as if she were planted on
the banks of the Neva. But the people of Chicago,
though locally divided into Northsiders, and Southsiders,
and Westsiders, are joined in interest for Chicago
against the world. Any project that promises
glory or profit for the Lake City will cause her citizens
to open their pocket books. These Illinois Don
Quixotes never tire of sounding the praises of their
Dulcinea, and are ever ready to break a lance in her
honor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not this race,” said Dr. Eustace, “under the
auspices of the National Exposition?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all,” replied the professor. “As I am informed,
a party of speculators leased a thousand acres
of land here, ten miles from the city limits. They
have, as you see, inclosed it and provided it with the
usual buildings, including seats for one hundred thousand
spectators. The race course is circular in form,
four miles in length, and seven railroad tracks are
laid around it. The officers of the leading railroad
corporations of the country readily consented to send
locomotives and engineers here to compete for the
prizes offered, and—you witness the result. This is
the third day of the races, and still the interest seems
undiminished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late in the month of July, 1892, and although
the World’s Exposition was not yet formally opened,
tens of thousands of strangers thronged the hotels of
Chicago and added to the gayety of her streets. The
great attraction of the day was the locomotive railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>race, and about twenty acres of people, representing
all nations, filled the benches and spread over the
outer circle of the great four-mile track.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven of the largest locomotives in America, selected
or constructed for this race, were steaming up
and down the tracks, waiting for the signal to range
themselves under a white cable, which was stretched
diagonally across the race course at such an angle as
to equalize the difference of length of inner and outer
tracks. Each locomotive was draped with its distinguishing
colors, worn also by its attendant engineer
and fireman. The favorite engine in the pool rooms
was the Chauncey M. Depew, entered by the New York
Central Railroad Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>The furnishings of this engine were of polished
silver, with draperies of blue silk, and the engineer
and fireman wore shirts and caps of the same color.</p>

<p class='c007'>The engine which most attracted the admiration of
the throng was the Collis P. Huntington, entered by
the Southern Pacific Company. All the furnishings as
well as the wheels of this locomotive were gilded and
burnished for the occasion. The attendants wore
shirts and caps of crimson, and the drapery consisted
of ropes of crimson roses, the freshness of which,
while coiled around smoke stack and boiler, was accounted
for by the fact that they were cut from asbestos
cloth made and tinted for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The directors of the railroad corporations centering
in Chicago had readily extended aid and co-operation
to the company organized in that city for the
construction and conduct of a locomotive race track,
for it was conceded that no more instructive school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>for engineers and firemen could have been devised,
and that there was no better field in which to make
experiments in machinery, tests of fuel consumption,
and economical creation and application of dynamic
force. Almost every railroad company in the United
States and Canada entered one or more locomotives
for the races, which were advertised for the last week
of July, 1892, and, notwithstanding the large sums offered
for premiums, and the great expense of building
and maintaining the race course, the enterprise proved
exceedingly profitable to its projectors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the one hundred and fifty thousand spectators
of the contest was Professor John Thornton, of
Boston, who, ten years before, had been the hardworking
principal of the Denver public schools, but
who, through the death of an uncle, inherited a fortune
of five millions of dollars, and was now one of the solid
men and social magnates of the Hub.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the years of poverty and struggle which
antedated Professor Thornton’s introduction to the
ranks of wealth, he had grown to regard very rich
men with aversion and contempt. He was fond of
quoting the aphorism that the Lord expressed his
opinion of money by the kind of men he bestowed
it upon, and he was stout in the belief that any man
who, in this world of human misery, could make and
keep five millions of dollars, was too selfish, if not too
dishonest, for an associate. He did not carry his
opinions so far as to refuse the estate which fell to him,
but he was exceedingly generous with his income, and
he never ceased to criticise the millionaires.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Thornton was generally regarded by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>friends as a Crœsus with the instincts of a Bohemian,
a sort of gilded <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-culotte</span></i>, with very radical opinions
and a very conservative bank account.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor was accompanied to the race course
by his family physician and old friend, Dr. Eustace.
This gentleman, unlike the professor, was optimistic in
his views of life. Pessimism, according to his belief,
might be sometimes necessary for ballast, but as
a rule he preferred to throw the sand and rocks overboard,
and load up with the silks and spices of Cathay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a country!” ejaculated the doctor, as, amid
the cheers of the multitude, one of the locomotives
dashed up the track to try her speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a great country,” said Professor Thornton,
“but will its peace and prosperity endure?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?” sententiously interposed Doctor
Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we,” replied the professor, “so much wiser
than the people of the republics which once encircled
the Mediterranean, that we can afford to disregard
the lesson imparted by their history?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you pretend to compare the ancient civilizations
with ours?” queried the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may not be gainsaid,” rejoined Thornton,
“that our civilization is superior to that of the ancients
in control and utilization of the forces of nature,
and it is also true that in the relations of the individual
to his government the former has gained in freedom
and in security of personal rights. But otherwise we
seem to be traveling the same round of national life
from infancy to decay, which marked the course of
Assyria, of Egypt, of Greece, and of Rome.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“But conditions were different with them,” remonstrated
the doctor. “Rome, even when a republic,
was such only in name. There was never any basis
of universal suffrage. The government of Rome was
always a military despotism, and her prætorian guard
sold the imperial purple, and rich men bought it, and
she fell because of her corruption.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we have legislators and bosses who sell offices,
and ambitious incapables who buy them,” answered
the professor. “And we are having now the same
vast accumulations of fortune in individual hands that
have ever proven the forerunners of national destruction
elsewhere. Wealth, corruption, weakness, decay,
the mob, and the despot have been the six stages
of national life with other republics, and I doubt
whether by harnessing steam and electricity to our
chariot we shall do more than expedite the journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor, you should go out as a missionary to
millionaires,” interposed the doctor, “and preach to
them the doctrines of nationalism.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor, you are satirical,” replied the professor,
“but I am not so sure that events are not fast making
missionaries of some such doctrine. Certainly the
pressing problem of the hour is that of dealing wisely
and justly with the new and unparalleled conditions
which vast wealth has created throughout the world,
and especially in these United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall prove equal to the problem,” said the
doctor cheerfully. “A people who, North and South,
were adequate to the achievements and sacrifices of
our Civil War, will never allow their government to be
overturned by a mob, or their politics to be always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>ruled by a few thousand wealth owners. And then
the personnels of the pauper and the capitalist are ever
changing. We have no law of entail by which the
founder of a fortune can perpetuate it in his descendants.
The vices and the brainlessness of the sons of
rich men will come to our aid, and in the third or
fourth generation the boatman’s oar and the peddler’s
pack will be resumed. Let the millionaires add to
their millions without molestation, say I. They cannot
take their gold away with them. It must remain
here, where it will again be distributed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor,” said the professor solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, John,” interrupted the doctor, laying his
hand familiarly on his friend’s shoulder, “possibly
the country may be going to ruin, but we shall have
time to see the race out. They are bringing the locomotives
in line ready to start. If they should come
out close together at the end, how are they going to
tell which wins?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The judge of this race, doctor,” explained the
professor, “is electrical and automatic and cannot
make a mistake. As soon as the engines are arranged
in line for starting, a wire will be stretched across the
track behind them. This wire will connect with a
registering apparatus, dial, and clock in front of the
grand stand, and each track is numbered. At the signal
bell for starting, the clockwork will be put in motion.
The first locomotive that crosses this wire will,
in the act of crossing, telegraph the number of its
track, close the circuit, and stop the clock, thus registering
the number of minutes, seconds, and quarter
seconds consumed in the run.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“How clever!” said the doctor. “Well, there
sounds the signal bell—they are off!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a shrill shriek of challenge from their throats
of steel, like unleashed hounds the giants bounded
away, gaining speed as they ran. In thirty-eight
seconds they rounded the curve by the half-mile post
without much change in their relative positions. The
next mile was made in fifty-five seconds, with the
Chauncey M. Depew, which had the inside track,
fifty yards ahead of the Collis P. Huntington, and the
others all the way from fifty to one hundred yards behind.
At the third mile post the Huntington and the
Depew rounded the curve almost side by side, with
trails of fire streaming from their smoke stacks, and
mingling in a luminous cloud, which hovered above
their distanced competitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with thunderous leaps and bounds, they came
down the home stretch, the one a streak of blue and
silver, the other a streak of gold and crimson, and the
roar of the multitude fairly drowned the shrieking of
the whistles as engineer James Flanagan, of the Southern
Pacific Company—his crimson cap gone, his black
hair streaming in the wind, and his red flannel shirt
open at the breast and almost blown from his massive
white shoulders—rode across the signal wire five feet
ahead of his competitor, winning the first prize of
$10,000 for his company and the diamond badge for
himself, making the run of four miles in three minutes
nine and one-quarter seconds, or at a rate of over
eighty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was nothing, sor,” said Flanagan to the vice
president of the Southern Pacific Company, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>climbed upon the cab of the locomotive to shake
hands with his engineer. “If it wasn’t for the time
lost in getting under way I’d engage to sind the Collis
P. around the four-mile track in two minutes and a
half. Sure, the machine was never built that could
catch her on a straight run. She’s a dandy and a
darlin’ and a glory to old California,” and he patted
the throttle valve affectionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Flanagan,” said Vice President Crocker, “the
owners of this race track have made one mistake
They give the diamond badge, worth $1,000, to the
engineer, and the purse of $10,000 to the company.
Suppose we trade and let the company take the
badge and you take the purse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, more power to you, Misther Crocker,” said
the delighted engineer. “It’s thrade I will, and may
you live until I offer to thrade back, and whin you
die may you go straight up, wid never a hot box to
delay you on your run to glory. I’ll give twinty-five
hundred dollars of the money to Dan Nilson, that
shoveled the coals unther the boiler, like the good
man he is, and wid the balance I’ll buy a chicken
ranch in Alameda that will be the makin’ of Missis
Flanagan and the kids.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the bench behind the professor and the doctor
two men were seated engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not asserting,” said one, “that the ore is so
very rich. It will average fifteen per cent in copper
carbonates, and that is good enough for anybody.
But I do say that the lode is an immense one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long do you suppose it would last, Bob, with
a dozen forty-ton furnaces at work on it?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Last? why, if you had Niagara for a water-power,
and the State of Colorado for a dumping-ground, and
hades for a smelting furnace, you couldn’t work that
ledge out in a million years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Bob,” laughed the other man, “I will go
and look at your mine. Can you start to-night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your time is mine,” was the response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very good; shall we go by the Iron Mountain
route, or by Kansas City?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will have to go by some other route than either,”
was the reply. “I cannot cross the State of Missouri;
I am honorably dead there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Honorably dead?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir. It was this way: I lived at Atchison for
a while when I was a young fellow, and Abe Simmons
and me were always at outs about something, and at
last we quarreled in dead earnest about a girl, and he
sent me a challenge to fight a duel. I always held
that dueling was a fool way to settle things, but I
wasn’t going to take water for no Missourian, and so
I placed myself in the hands of my second, as they
call it among the chivs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Abe’s second and my second were good
friends of both of us, and they were in for a sort of a
lark, and they fixed it up to paint two life-sized pictures,
one of Abe and one of me, on the door of an
old stable, and we was each to fire at the picture of
the other at the word. They had three doctors to examine
the wounds on the paintings, and if they decided
that the wound was mortal, then the fellow whose picture
was killed had to consider himself honorably dead,
and was to leave Missouri and never return. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>wound was not mortal, he had to lay up and keep his
bed for such time as the doctors agreed would be
necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, sir, they made a circus of us, that’s a fact.
We both signed a paper agreeing on honor to carry
out the arrangement, and we went out one broiling
afternoon in August in pursuit of each other’s gore.
The boys had passed the word, and we played to a
bigger audience than was ever at a Democratic barbecue.
I was the best shot, but I was getting ashamed
of the whole business, and I fired in a hurry, and only
plugged Abe’s picture through its gambrel joint. He
took a dead sight and shot my picture plumb through
the heart. I wanted three days to settle my business,
but the doctors decided that the weather was so hot I
wouldn’t keep more than twelve hours, and accordingly
I lit out for Pike’s Peak—as it was then called—the
next morning, and I have never touched the soil
of Missouri since.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about Abe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The doctors agreed that he had to go on crutches
for three months, and the boys laughed at him—so I
heard—so much that at the end of the second week he
limped out to his father’s ranch, and stayed there until
his time was up, when he went to St. Louis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the girl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, of course I was a corpse, and she had no
use for me, and Abe had, before the duel, invited her
to a dance, and, naturally, being a cripple, he couldn’t
go, and she allowed that she would neither go to a
dance or tie herself for life to a man with a lame leg,
and she married another fellow altogether. But you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>see I cannot honorably go into Missouri unless I can
travel on a corpse ticket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Bob, your remains shall not violate your
pledge. We will keep out of Missouri this trip.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Mr. Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor turned at the sound of the name, and,
looking his neighbor in the face, exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“David Morning, have you altogether forgotten an
old friend? True, it is nearly ten years since I saw
you last, in Denver, but surely I have not changed so
very much since then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgotten you, Professor Thornton?” replied the
party addressed, as he shook hands warmly, “forgotten
you? no, indeed. I do not need to ask if you
are well—and your wife and daughter? Are they both
with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Both are in Boston, and well, thank you. Do you
remain long in Chicago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I leave to-night for the West. Pray convey to
your family my remembrances and regards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not fail to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The crowd seems to be going, professor; I suppose
we must say good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, then, and a pleasant journey to you.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='small'>“The light that shone when hope was born.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the early dawn of an August day in the year of
grace eighteen hundred and ninety-two, David Morning
stepped through the French window of his bedroom
out upon the broad and sheltered piazza of the
railroad station hotel at Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mass of straight brown hair crowned rather than
shaded a broad, high brow, over the surface of which
thought and time had indented a few lines which gave
strength and meaning to the face. Eyes of sea gray
hue, as candid and as translucent as the deeps which
they resembled, were divided by a nose somewhat too
thick at the base for perfect features but running to
an aquiline point, with the thin and flexible nostrils
of the racer. A short upper lip was covered with a
luxuriant chestnut brown mustache, shading a chin
which, though long and resolute and firmly upheld
against the upper lip, was yet divided by a deep dimple
which quivered with sensitiveness. A thick-set
but graceful and erect figure, clothed in a suit of dark
blue flannel, completed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> of the subject
of our sketch, who, with thirty-two years of human
experience behind him, had stepped five hours
before from the West-bound Pullman sleeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Morning—the only child of a Connecticut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>father and a Knickerbocker mother—was born and
passed the days of his boyhood in the city of New
York, where he was a pupil of the public schools,
and where he was making preparation for entering
upon a course at Yale, when, at sixteen years of age,
the sudden death of his father, followed within a fortnight
by that of his mother, compelled him to surrender
his studies and seek a means of livelihood.</p>

<p class='c007'>A distant relative offered him a place as clerk in a
general merchandise store in Southern Colorado,
whither the lad journeyed. For two years he faithfully
served his employer. Always of an exploring
and adventurous disposition, he had, while “geologizing”—as
he called it—in the neighboring hills, in
company with a prospector who had taken a fancy to
“the kid,” discovered a quartz lode, which his companion
located on joint account, David being under
age. This location was soon afterwards sold to an
Eastern company for the sum of $20,000, of which
the lad received one-half. Declining several friendly
offers to invest the money in promising mines, he
wisely determined to return East and resume the
studies which had been interrupted by the death of
his parents; but, guided by his Colorado experience,
and having a strong inclination for the vocation of a
mining engineer, he determined to study in special
lines which were outside of the usual collegiate
course. He had not deemed it necessary to leave his
own country to obtain the necessary instruction, and,
four years later, he found himself with $5,000 left of
his capital, with no knowledge of the Greek alphabet
and but small acquaintance with Latin, yet able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>speak and write fluently French, Spanish, and German,
and possessed of a good knowledge of geology,
metallurgy, chemistry, and both civil and mechanical
engineering, and with a cultivated as well as a natural
taste for politico-economic science.</p>

<p class='c007'>At twenty-two years of age, having completed his
studies, David Morning located in Denver, adopted
the profession of a civil and mining engineer, and
promptly proceeded to fall in love with the only
daughter of Professor John Thornton, the principal
of the Denver public schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ellen Thornton at seventeen gave abundant promise
of the splendid womanhood that was to follow.
Above the middle height, slender in form, and graceful
in carriage, with a broad, low brow crowned with
silky, lustrous, dark hair, and eyes of chestnut brown,
that, in moments of inspiration, grew radiant as stars,
she captivated the young engineer and was readily
captivated by him in turn. An engagement of marriage
followed, to be fulfilled as soon as the clientage
of Morning should be sufficient to warrant the union.</p>

<p class='c007'>But business comes slowly to young men of two
and twenty, and Ellen’s mother grew impatient of the
fetters which she deemed kept her charming daughter
from more advantageous arrangements. Ellen was
proud-spirited and ambitious, and, although she was
earnest and conscientious, she was not so stable of
purpose as to be unaffected by the arguments and appeals
of her mother. At times she was sure that she
loved David Morning, and at other times she was not
so sure that her love was of that enduring and devoted
character which a wife should feel for her husband.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Her reading had created in her mind a conception of
an ideal passion which she could not feel had as yet
come into her life. She believed that her affianced
had undeveloped powers that would some day bring
him fame and fortune, and again she was not so sure
that he possessed the tact and persistence to utilize
his powers to the best advantage. This doubt would
not have deterred her from fulfilling her engagement
of marriage if she had been entirely certain of her love
for him. But she was divided by doubts as to whether
the affection she felt was really the ideal and exalted
passion of her dreams, or only a strong desire for a
companionship which she found to be exceedingly
pleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not quite certain in all things of her affianced,
not quite certain of herself, not quite certain of
anything, and one day, yielding to an irresistible
impulse of doubt and hesitancy, she asked to be released
from her engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning was amazed, indignant, and almost heartbroken
at her request. Had he been of riper age and
experience he would have known how to allow for the
doubts and self-questionings of a young girl in her
first love affair, but he was as unsophisticated as she,
and more secure in his own possession of himself.
Frank and proud, he took her at the word, which she
regretted almost as soon as it was uttered. He neither
sued nor remonstrated, but with only a “God bless
you” and a “good-by,” and without even a request
for a parting kiss, which, if given, might have opened
the way to a better understanding, he hurriedly left
the house.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The next day he was on his way to Leadville, in
fulfillment of a professional engagement, and when he
returned two weeks later he found that his former
affianced had accompanied her parents to Boston,
where Professor Thornton had been suddenly called
by the death of a relative, to whose large fortune he
succeeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero did not despair, and, having no natural inclination
for dissipation, did not make his rejection an
excuse and an opportunity for self-indulgence. He
was of an intense and earnest nature, and he was really
in love with the girl who had discarded him, but life
was not dead of duty or achievement to him because
of her loss, which he looked upon as final, for her
newly-acquired position as a wealthy heiress made it
impossible to his self-respect to seek a reconciliation.
He applied himself with assiduity and industry to his
profession, and soon became an exceedingly skillful and
reliable mining expert.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ability to comprehend the story written upon the
rocks cannot always be gained by study or experience.
At last it is a “faculty,” rather than the result of reading
or training. Fire and flood, oxygen and electricity,
the tempests of the air and the volcanic throbbings
of the earth, have been busy for ages with the quartz
lode, and have left their marks upon it. It is possible
sometimes to decipher these hieroglyphics so as to
answer with a degree of accuracy the ever-recurring
question, “Will it pay to work?” Yet such possibility
cannot be reduced to a science. Professors of
geology and metallurgy are often wrong in their conclusions,
and even old prospectors are frequently at
fault.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Go across a piece of marsh land on a spring morning
accompanied by a bull-dog and a Gordon setter.
The former will flush no snipe save those he may
fairly run over as he trots along. But the fine nose
of the dog with the silky auburn coat will catch the
scent of the wary bird, and follow it here and there
around tufts of marsh grass and across strips of meadow,
until the sagacious canine shall be seen outlined against
earth and sky. It is difficult to be certain of anything
in this world of human deceptions, but one may be
absolutely sure under such circumstances that the dog
will not lie, and that he cannot be mistaken. There
is a snipe within a few yards of that dog in the direction
in which his nose is pointed. If the sportsman
fails to secure the bird, the fault will be with his aim or
his fowling-piece—the dog has done his part.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some men—even among experienced miners—have
the bull-dog’s obtuseness, and some have an eye for
quartz equal to the nose of a pointer for snipe. David
Morning was of this latter class, and to the thorough
training which he had received during his four years’
studies he speedily added that practical knowledge of
the rocks which, guided by natural aptitudes and intuitions,
will enable the wooer of the hills to gain
their golden favors. His honesty, good judgment,
and fidelity caused his services to be eagerly sought
by the mining companies, which—after the Leadville
discoveries—abounded in Colorado, and at the date
at which our narrative opens he had acquired a fortune
of about $300,000, which was invested mainly in
mortgages upon business property in Denver. But
he made no attempt at further attendance on Cupid’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>court, and, indeed, gave but little attention to
society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, while the physical Ellen Thornton thus passed
out of the young man’s life, there came into his soul
instead an ideal, whose influence was ever an inspiration
to higher thinking, purer life, gentler judgments,
and loftier deeds. Well has the poet said, “’Tis
better to have loved and lost than never to have loved
at all.” No man can be possessed by love for a good
woman without being thereby moved upward on all
the lines of existence. Damps cannot dim the diamond;
its facets and angles of fire will never permit
the fog to abide with them. From the hour that his
heart is touched with the electric passion, the lover
is in harmony with all delights.</p>

<p class='c007'>The waters tinkle and the lark sings for him with
sweeter notes, while the sunlight is more radiant, and
the hills are robed with a softer purple. The woman
who has evoked the one passion of a man’s life may
become as dead to him as the occupant of an Etruscan
tomb, but the love itself will abide with him to enrich
his life, and journey with him into the other country.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Morning found in books the most pleasant
and absorbing companionship, and those who gained
admittance to his library were surprised to learn that
there was a dreamy, speculative, poetical side to the
busy, practical mining engineer. All the great authors
on mental, moral, and political economy were well-thumbed
comrades, and the covers of the leading
English and German poets and essayists were free
from dust. Especially was he a close and interested
student of social science, and he had his theories
concerning changes of various natures in society and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>governments which might ameliorate the condition
and elevate the lives and purposes of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In religion Morning was neither an accepter nor an
agnostic. His reading taught him that all religions
inculcate the righteousness of truth, honesty, and unselfishness,
and that any form of faith in the hereafter
is better for the world than no faith at all. The Persian
who bowed devoutly to the highest material sign
of Deity, the sun, was thereby filled with a spirit
which made him readier to relieve the misery of his
brother. The Egyptian who brought tribute to the
priests of Isis and Osiris, was the better for his self-denial.
The Greek who believed in Minerva was a
closer student. Odin’s followers scorned a lie. Confucius
taught love of home and kindred. Mahomet
prescribed temperance, and the pure and gentle faith
of Buddha in its benefactions to the human race has
been exceeded only by the benign power of the religion
of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Skeptics strengthen their scoffings by recounting
the wars and cruelties—in bygone centuries—of zealots
insane with fervor. But these are only spots upon the
sun. The rusty thumbscrews of the Inquisition, and
the ashes of the fires amid which Servetus perished—fires
unkindled and dead for three hundred years—may
be forgotten when one considers the hospitals,
and schools, and houses of shelter which now link
their shadows across continents.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days before, while attending the locomotive
races in Chicago, Morning had met an old mining
friend, at whose earnest insistence he had been induced
to visit and examine, with a view of purchasing, a
large and promising ledge of copper in the Santa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Catalina Mountains. It was the pursuit of this purpose
that had brought him to Tucson.</p>

<p class='c007'>From his seat on the hotel piazza David Morning
gazed into the little triangular garden beneath, with
its splashing fountain guarded by fragrant honey locust
trees, its close-knit, dark green lawn of Australian
grass, and its collection of weird and ugly cacti,
transplanted from their native sand for the edification
of passing tourists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, raising his eyes, he beheld the ancient adobe
pueblo, with a few belated saloon lights blinking
through the murk, which was now slowly changing
into ashen dawn. In the east a pencil line of light
was beginning to glow, and to the northward the
blackish purple of the Santa Catalina Range upreared
itself against the night sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>In yonder mountains, as tenantless, as forbidding,
as inaccessible, and almost as unexplored as when they
were first upheaved from the tortured breast of chaos,
there reposed the golden power which, in the hands of
David Morning, was to change the economic and
social relations of mankind, and, possibly, the governments,
the boundaries, and the history of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing of these ripening purposes of Omniscience
were then revealed to the soul of our hero; none of
them even rested in his dreams. Yet the nations,
weary of centuries of error, centuries of wrong, centuries
of toil and tears and martyrdom, were waiting,
even as he was waiting before commencing his work,
for the light which every moment grew brighter in its
scarlet beauty against the eastern horizon—the light
which was to guide humanity to its destiny of better
days.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='small'>“The storm is abroad in the mountains.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Santa Catalina Mountains, although commonly
designated as a part of the Sierra Madres, are,
in truth, a small, isolated range, towering to a height
of seven or eight thousand feet above the surrounding
plains. They are steep, rugged, and practically
inaccessible, except at the eastern end, where they may
be entered through a long, narrow, crooked canyon,
which runs from the plain or mesa to within a short
distance of the summit. This canyon widens at intervals
into small valleys, few of which exceed a dozen
acres in extent, and through it the Rillito, a mountain
stream, carrying, ordinarily, about five hundred
miner’s inches of water, tumbles and splashes. Along
and above the bed of this stream, at a height of fifty
feet or more, in order to avoid the freshets created by
the summer rains, runs a very primitive wagon road,
which was constructed for the purpose of allowing
supplies to be transported to the miners, who, during
the era of high prices for copper, were engaged in
taking ore from the carbonate lodes which exist in
abundance in a range of hills half way to the summit
and ten miles from the mouth of the canyon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower hills of the Santa Catalinas are covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>with a scant growth of mesquite and palo verde, along
the Rillito there is a fringe of willows and cottonwoods,
and near the summit is a large body of pine timber,
but its practical inaccessibility and distance from any
available market have protected it from the woodman’s
ax. The absence of any extent of agricultural or
grazing land in the Santa Catalinas has proven a
bar to their occupation by settlers, and their isolation,
rugged nature, and unpromising geological formation,
have deterred prospectors from thoroughly exploring
them. Such searchers for treasure as visited them
always returned with a verdict of “no good,” until a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i> understanding was reached by the miners and
prospectors of Arizona that it was useless to waste
time looking for gold or silver in their fastnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above the copper belt no prospector was ever able
to find trace or color of any metal, and the low price
of copper and the high charges for railroad freight
which prevailed in 1883 and succeeding years, caused
abandonment of the rude workings for that metal, and
at the date of the opening of our narrative it might
have been truly said that the entire Santa Catalina
Range was without an occupant.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the western and southern end of the range its
summit and rim consist of a huge basaltic formation,
towering perpendicularly one thousand feet, upon the
apex of which probably no human footstep was ever
placed, for its character excluded all probability of
quartz being found there, even by the Arizona prospector,
who will climb to any place that can be reached
by a goat or an eagle, if so be silver and not scenery
entice him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>In the spring of 1892 Robert Steel, who, in years
gone, had acted as superintendent of a copper company
operating in the Santa Catalinas, and was familiar
with the ground, had been inspired by a considerable
advance in the price of copper to visit the scene
of his former labors and relocate the abandoned claims.
It was at his solicitation and representations that
David Morning, who had known him well in Colorado,
was induced to take a trip to Arizona to examine the
properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert Steel was designated by those who knew
him best as “a true fissure vein.” With hair that was
unmistakably red, and eyes that were blue as the sky,
with the upper part of his face covered with tan and
freckles, and the lower part disguised by a heavy
brick-red beard, his personal appearance was not entirely
prepossessing to the casual observer. But under
the husk of roughness was a heart both tender and
true, a loyalty that would never tire, a thorough
knowledge of his business as a miner, and a tried and
dauntless courage that, in the performance of duty,
would, to quote the vernacular of the Arizonian, “have
fought a rattlesnake, and given the snake the first
bite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He carried his forty years with the vigor of a boy,
and his occasional impecuniosity, which he accounted
for incorrectly by saying that he “had been agin faro,”
was in fact the result of continued investments in giving
an education to his two young brothers, and furnishing
a comfortable home and support for his parents
and sisters in Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many Robert Steels to be found among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the prospectors of the far West. They are the brightest,
bravest, most generous, enterprising, and energetic
men on earth. They are the Knights Paladin,
who challenge the brute forces of nature to combat,
the soldiers who, inspired by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aura sacra fames</span></i>,
face the storm and the savage, the desert and disease.
They crawl like huge flies upon the bald skulls of lofty
mountains; they plod across alkaline deserts, which
pulse with deluding mirages under the throbbing light;
they smite with pick and hammer the adamantine
portals of the earth’s treasure chambers, and at their
“open sesame” the doors roll back and reveal their
stores of wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are readier with rifle or revolver than with
scriptural quotation, and readier yet with “coin sack”
at the call of distress, and they are not always unaccustomed
to the usages of polite society, though they
scorn other than their occasional exercise. Under
the gray shirts may be found sometimes graduates
from Yale, and sometimes fugitives from Texas, but
always hearts that pulse to the appeals of friendship
or the cries of distress, even “as deeps answer to the
moon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among these pioneers no one man assumes to be
better than another, and no man concedes his inferiority
to anybody. In the last forty years they have
carried the civilization, the progress, and the power
of the nineteenth century to countries which were beforetime
unexplored. In their efforts some have found
fortune and some have found unmarked graves upon
the hillside. Some with whitened locks but spirits
yet aflame continue the search for wealth, and some,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>wearied of the search, patiently await the summons to
cross the ridge. Wherever they roam, and whether
they spin the woof of rainbows upon this or upon the
other side, they will be happy, for they will be busy
and hopeful, and labor and hope carry their heaven
with them evermore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days after the arrival of David Morning at
Tucson he left for the Santa Catalinas. The party
consisted of Morning and Steel and two miners who
were employed for the expedition. A wagon drawn
by four serviceable mules was loaded with tools, tents,
camp equipages, saddles and bridles, provisions, and
grain for the animals sufficient for a week’s use. Late
in the afternoon of the second day the site of the
copper locations was reached, and a camp made upon
the mesa a few hundred feet from and above the bed
of the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cursory examination of the copper locations
made before nightfall satisfied Morning that before
he could form any judgment upon which he would be
willing to act in making a purchase, it would be necessary
to clean out one of the old shafts, which had,
since the mines were abandoned, been partially filled
with loose rock and earth. This work it was estimated
could be performed by Robert Steel and his
two miners in about three days, and while it was being
done Morning proposed to explore, or at least
visit, the source of the stream, near the summit of the
range ten miles away. Assuring Steel that he was
an old mountaineer, and that no apprehensions need
be felt for his safety if he did not return until the end
of two or three days, Morning saddled one animal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and, loading another with blankets, camp equipage,
a pick, a fowling-piece, and three days’ provisions, he
departed next morning, after an early breakfast, for
the trip up the cañon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above the old copper camp the wagon road came
to an end, and only a rough trail running along and
often in the creek took its place. Following the
trail, Morning proceeded, driving his pack mule ahead,
until, at a point about six miles from where he had left
his companions, further progress with animals was
found to be impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>One hundred feet above the bed of the stream,
which here emerged with a rush from a narrow gorge,
was a plateau of probably ten acres in extent, on
which were a number of large oak trees, and the
ground of which was at this season covered with a
heavy growth of alfilaria, or native clover. Here
Morning unloaded and tethered his mules, and made
for himself a temporary camp under a huge live oak
tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>After eating his luncheon, he buckled a pistol about
his waist, that he might not be altogether unprepared
for a possible deer, and, using a pole-pick for a walking
staff, he climbed out of the cañon and commenced
the ascent of the mountain to the southward. It appeared
to be about a thousand feet in height, and upon
its summit towered, one thousand feet higher, the
basaltic wall which Morning recognized as that which
was visible from Tucson, and which formed the southern
and western rim of the Santa Catalina Mountains.
His purpose was to reach at least the base of this wall,
and ascertain if there were any means of ascending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>it to its summit, from which it might be possible to
obtain an extended view of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>After half an hour’s hard climbing, our adventurer
gained this wall and found along its base a natural
road, with an ascent of probably three hundred feet
to the mile. Slowly plodding his way among the
loose rock and débris, which had, during many ages,
scaled and fallen from the basalt, he soon reached an
opening about sixty feet in width.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supposing that this might be a cañon or gorge
that would furnish a means of ascending the wall, he
turned into it. In a little more than a quarter of a mile
it came to an abrupt termination. It was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</span></i>,
a rift in the wall made in some convulsion of nature.
It ascended very slightly, being almost level, and at
both sides and at the end the basalt towered for a
thousand feet sheer to the summit, without leaving
a break upon which even a bird could set its foot.
It was now midday, but the rays of the sun did not
penetrate to the bottom of this rift, and the atmosphere
and light were those of an autumn twilight.</p>

<p class='c007'>After ascertaining the nature and extent of the gorge,
Morning turned, and, plodding through the sand
and loose rock to its entrance, resumed his journey
along the base of the great wall. The ascent of the
little ridge or natural road grew steeper and steeper,
until at length the top was reached, and our explorer
stood upon the summit of the great basaltic formation,
a mile in width and ten miles in length, which forms
the southwestern rim or table of the Santa Catalinas.
From near the outer edge spread as grand a prospect
as was ever vouschafed to the eye of mortal. Tucson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>seven thousand feet below and fifteen miles away,
seemed almost at the foot of the mountain. To the
southeast stretched a narrow, winding ribbon of green,
the homes of the Mexicans, who, with their ancestors,
have for more than two centuries occupied the valley
of the Santa Cruz. Farther yet to the southward the
lofty Huachucas towered. Northward a higher peak
of the Catalinas cut off the view, but to the southwest
broad mesas and billowy hills stretched for more than
a hundred and fifty miles, until at the horizon the eye
rested upon the blue of the Gulf of California, penciled
against an ashen strip of sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Morning gazed in awe and delight, there appeared
in the sky, scudding from the south, flecks of
cloud, chasing each other like gulls upon an ocean,
and remembering that this was the rainy season, and
feeling rather than knowing that a storm was about to
gather, Morning retraced his steps. He had proceeded
on his return to a point about five hundred
yards above the mouth of the rift which he had visited
on his upward journey, when the rapidly-darkening
clouds and big plashes of rain drops warned him that
one of the showers customary in that section in August
was about to fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such storms are usually of brief duration, but are
liable to be exceedingly violent, the water often descending
literally in sheets. It would have been impossible
for Morning to reach the camp where he
had left the animals in time to avoid the storm, and
a hollow in the basalt wall—a hollow which almost
amounted to a cave—offering just here a complete
shelter from the rain, which was approaching from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the south, over the top of the wall, he sought the
opening, and was soon seated upon a convenient rock,
while his vision swept the slope to the cañon a mile
below, and thence followed the meanderings of the
Rillito until it vanished from sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the clouds grew and darkened. Like black
battalions of Afrites summoned by the “thunder drum
of heaven,” they trooped from distant mountains and
nearer plains to gather upon the summit of the Catalinas.
The south wind—now risen to a gale—swooped
up the fogs from the distant gulf, and hurried them
upon its mighty pinions, shrieking with delight at the
burden it bore up to the summit of the basalt, above
which it massed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the demons of the upper ether reached their
electric-tipped fingers into the dense black watery
masses, and whirled them into a denser circle, whirled
them into an hour glass, whose tip was in the heavens
and whose base was carried by the giant force thus
generated slowly along and just above the top of the
great wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whirled in a demon waltz to the music of the shaking
crags, yet touching not those peaks, for to touch them
would have been destruction, the circling ocean in the
air sailed, roaring and shrieking, to the eastward, growing
denser and more powerful, and black with the
blackness of the nethermost pit, as it journeyed on.
At last it reached the blind cañon so lately visited by
our explorer. The air—imprisoned between the earth
and the clouds—rushed with a tortured yell down the
rift in the mountain. The wall of water sank as its
support tumbled from beneath it; its base touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the ragged rocky edges of the cleft; the compactness
of the fluid mass was broken, and the forces fled and
left to its fate the watery monster they had engendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a roar louder than a thousand peals of
thunder, with throbs and gaspings like the death
rattle of a giant, the waterspout burst, and its vast
volume descended into the gorge, down which it
seethed with the power of a cataclysm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of the mouth of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</span></i> a torrent issued,
or rather a wall of water hundreds of feet in height.
Down the mountain side it sped, tearing a channel
deep and wide, and crumbling into a thousand cataracts
of foam, which spread and submerged the slope.
A deep depression or basin on the side of the mountain
just southward of the bed of the Rillito deflected
the torrent for a few hundred yards, and it rushed into
this basin and filled it, and, leaving a small lake as a
souvenir of its visit, went roaring down the cañon,
which it entered again about a quarter of a mile below
the spot where Morning had tethered his mules.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not more than fifteen minutes had elapsed since the
bursting of the waterspout when the storm was over,
the sun was shining, the water had departed down the
cañon, and our awe-stricken witness to this mighty
sport of elemental forces started to retrace his steps.
He had witnessed the deflection of the water wall, and
knew that his animals were safe, and he also knew that
no harm would come to his companions down the
cañon, for their camp was hundreds of feet above the
bed of the ravine.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes’ walk brought Morning to the mouth
of the gorge which he had visited an hour or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>before. From it a small stream of water—the remains
of the waterspout—was yet running, and, being curious
to observe the effects produced upon the spot which
first received the fury of the waters, he descended into
the channel which had been torn by the torrent, and
again entered the rift.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tremendous force of the vast body of water
precipitated into the gorge had excavated and swept
through its opening the fallen and decomposed rock
and sand and bowlders which had been accumulating
for centuries. The channel rent by the waters as they
emerged was quite twenty feet in depth and sixty feet
in width, and Morning found that the floor of the box
cañon had been torn away to a similar depth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The waterspout had accomplished in one minute a
work that would have required the industrious labor
of one thousand men for a month. The gorge was
swept clean to the bed rock, which showed blue limestone,
and in the center of this limestone bed there
now stood erect, to a height of twelve feet, a ledge of
white and rose-colored quartz of regular and unbroken
formation, forty feet in width, running from near the
entrance of the rift to the end of it, where it disappeared
under the basalt wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experienced eye of Morning taught him at a
glance that this was a true fissure vein of quartz, and a
brief examination of some pieces which he knocked
off with his pole-pick convinced him that it was rich
in gold. But for the waterspout which had swept away
the sand, gravel, and loose rocks which ages of disintegration
of the face of the wall had deposited over
this lode, its existence must ever have remained undiscovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>for there were no exterior evidences of the
existence of quartz, to tempt a prospector to sink a
shaft.</p>

<p class='c007'>The primal instinct of the miner is to locate his
“find,” and Morning proceeded forthwith to acquire
title to “the unoccupied mineral lands of the United
States” so marvelously brought to light. His notebook
furnished paper for location notices, and an hour’s
work enabled him to build location monuments of
loose stone, in which his notices were deposited.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now more than two hours since the waterspout
had expended its force. Morning conjectured
that Steel and his miners, after the flood had passed
them, would probably set out in search of him, and he
did not wish his location to be discovered until he
should have perfected it by recording at Tucson, and
possibly not then. But he knew that it would require
at least three hours for the men at the copper-camp to
reach him, and, though the light in the cañon was beginning
to grow dim, he determined not to leave there
without further examination of the ledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, he walked around it and climbed over
it. From its summit and its sides at twenty different
places he broke off specimens, which he deposited in
his pockets until they were full to bursting. It was
beginning to grow dark when he emerged from the
rift and started along the base of the basalt. He had
not proceeded a hundred yards from the mouth of the
rift, when he beheld three figures a quarter of a mile
distant, rapidly picking their way along the channel
which had been worn by the torrent in its descent of
the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Five minutes more in the gorge and his secret
would have been discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shouted to his friends, who responded to his hail,
and in a few minutes they met and descended the
mountain together to the plateau under the trees,
where the tethered animals, surfeited with alfilirea, were
whinnying loudly for human companionship.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was too late to attempt to return to the copper-camp
that night, and, indeed, daylight was needed for
the journey, for the trail had been in many places
washed away by the flood.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a supper, which made havoc with the three
days’ rations, a large fire was built, more for cheerfulness
than for warmth, blankets were divided, and all
retired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning slept less soundly than his fellows, for his
quick and accurate brain was filled with an idea of the
colossal fortune and the mighty trust that the events
of that day had placed in his hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='small'>“Gold is the strength of the world.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Morning concluded it would be unwise to make another
trip to his location, lest suspicion might be excited
and discovery follow, so, breaking camp early
the next day, he returned with his comrades to the
copper-lodes, which they reached before noon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Work was resumed by Steel and his two miners in
clearing the old shaft, and Morning, taking a fowling-piece,
avowed his purpose to look for quail down the
ravine. Having reached a point where he felt secluded
from observation, he began a critical examination of
the quartz specimens, which until now he had not
dared to withdraw from his pockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>As with his microscope he scrutinized piece after
piece, he grew pale with excitement and astonishment.
With the habit of a mining expert, he had sampled the
ledge as for an average, and the average value of the
twenty different specimens of quartz, taken from
twenty different localities, enabled him to determine
the true value of the property with great accuracy.
He discovered that the amount of gold in each one of
the twenty specimens would not vary materially from
the amount of gold in proportion to the quartz in each
and all of the others. In other words, the entire body
of quartz was uniformly impregnated with gold, and,
therefore, of uniform richness and value.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>There was no better judge of quartz in all Colorado
than David Morning. He had been accustomed, after
careful inspection, to estimate within ten or twenty percent
of the value per ton of free milling gold quartz,
and his accuracy had often been the subject of amicable
wagers among his friends. He was able in this
instance to say that each one of the ore specimens
carried not less than five hundred ounces of gold to
the ton of quartz, or that the entire lode would yield,
under the stamps, an average of $10,000 per ton.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was marvelous! unprecedented! phenomenal!
No such deposit for richness and extent had ever been
found in the history of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten thousand dollars in gold, distributed through
two thousand pounds of quartz, may not make much
of a showing in the quartz, for in bulk there is fifty
times as much quartz as gold; but one hundred tons
of such quartz would yield a million dollars, and the
ledge uncovered by the waterspout was forty feet in
width and thirteen hundred and sixty feet in length
to where it ran under the basalt wall. It cropped
twelve feet above the ground, and extended to unknown
depths below the surface. Thirteen feet of rock
in place will weigh a ton. In that rift in the mountain
there was now in sight above the surface, all ready to
be broken down and sent to the stamps, six hundred
and fifty thousand cubic feet, or fifty thousand tons, of
quartz, containing gold of the value of $500,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was to be done with the vast amount of gold
which might be extracted from the Morning mine?
How was it to be placed in circulation without unsettling
values, reducing the worth of all bonds, inaugurating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>wild speculation, and revolutionizing the commerce
and the finances of the world?</p>

<p class='c007'>Would not the nations, so soon as they should be
made aware of the existence of this deposit, hasten to
demonetize gold, make of it a commodity, change the
world’s standard money to silver exclusively, and so
lessen the value of the Morning mine to a comparatively
small amount?</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the plea that increased production of silver
necessitated a change in relative values, that metal
was demonetized in 1873 in Europe and in the United
States, and its value reduced one-third. Might not
gold now be similarly dealt with, and, with such a vast
deposit known to be in existence, be diminished by
demonetization to the value of silver or less?</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire production of gold in the world for the
last forty years, or since the California and Australia
mines began to yield, had been but $5,000,000,000,
and as much might be extracted from the first one
hundred and twenty feet in depth of the Morning
mine. All the gold money of the world was but
$7,600,000,000, or less than might be excavated from
the first two hundred feet in depth of this marvelous
deposit. The total money of the world—gold, silver,
and paper—was but $11,500,000,000, and a similar
sum might be extracted from the first three hundred
feet in depth of the mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the ledge extended downward a thousand feet, it
contained as much gold as three times the sum total
of all the gold, silver, and paper currency of the world,
and its value was equal to the value, in the year eighteen
hundred and ninety, of one-half of all the real
and personal property in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>How much of this gold could be added to the circulation
of the world with safety? and how could the
existence of the vast quantity held in reserve be kept
secret?</p>

<p class='c007'>His studies in political economy had taught David
Morning that gold, like water, if fed to the land in
proper proportions, would stimulate its fertility and
add to its power of beneficent production, but if precipitated
in an unregulated and mighty torrent, would,
like the waterspout, prove a destructive power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowledge of the existence of the gold, if generally
diffused, would be nearly as injurious to the world
as to extract it and place it in the channels of finance.
Yet how could the secret be kept? The ledge as it
stood could not be worked without half a hundred
men knowing its extent and value. No guards or
bonds of secrecy would be adequate. The birds of
the air would carry the tale. Even now a vagrant
prospector or wandering mountain tourist might reveal
the secret to the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not in any spirit of self-seeking did David Morning
ask himself these questions. All his personal wants,
and tastes, and aspirations might be gratified with a
few millions, which could easily be mined and invested
before knowledge of his discovery could destroy or
lessen the value of gold. But the purpose now beginning
to take possession of him was to use, not
merely millions, but tens and hundreds and thousands
of millions, to bring peace, and progress, and prosperity
to the nations, to ameliorate the conditions under
which humanity suffers, to raise the fallen, to aid
the struggling, to curb the power of oppressors, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>remedy public and private wrongs, to solve social problems,
to uplift humanity, and comfort the bodies and
souls of men. To accomplish this work it was necessary
that he should have vast sums at his command,
and it was also necessary that his possession of vaster
reserves should not be known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The discoveries in California and Australia by which
in ten years fourteen hundred millions of gold dollars
were added to the world’s stock of the precious metals
was a beneficent discovery. It lifted half the weight
from the shoulders of every debtor; it made possible
the payment of every farm mortgage; it delivered
manhood from the evil embrace of Apathy, and
wedded him to fair young Hope; it invigorated commerce,
it inspired enterprise, it led the armies of peace
to the conquest of forest and prairie; it caused furnaces
to flame and spindles to hum; it brought plenty and
progress to a people.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this addition to the gold money of civilization
was gradually made, and the product of forty years of
all the gold mines in the world was not equal to the
sum which in less than four years might be taken from
the Morning mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, as a consequence of Morning’s find, gold should
not be demonetized, if it should be permitted to remain
as a measurer of all values, and the extent of
the deposit should be made known to the world, the
inevitable result would be to quadruple the prices of
land, labor, and goods, and to reduce to one-fourth
of their present proportions the value to the creditor
of all existing indebtedness. The farmer whose land
was worth $10,000 would find it worth $40,000, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the man who had loaned $5,000 upon it would find
his loan worth but $1,250 practically, because the purchasing
power of his $5,000 would be reduced to one-fourth
of its present capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>All government bonds of the nations, all county,
city, and railroad bonds, and all the mortgages and
promissory notes and book accounts in the world,
would, if all of Morning’s gold should be poured at
once into circulation, without preparation or warning,
be reduced at one blow to one-fourth of their present
value, and all the owners of land, and implements,
and horses, and cattle, and merchandise would find
their value at once increased fourfold. The laborer
who had only his hands or his brains would remain
unaffected. His wages would be quadrupled, and so
would the cost of his living.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowledge of the extent of the Morning mine
would immediately enrich the debtors and ruin the
creditors of the world, unless the governments of earth
should demonetize gold, deny it access to the mints,
refuse to coin it, and so degrade it to a commodity.</p>

<p class='c007'>An illustration in a small way of the operations of
this immutable law of finance may be found in the
history of San Francisco. The foundations of some
of the great fortunes of that city may be traced to the
days of the Civil War, when San Francisco wholesale
merchants paid their Eastern creditors in legal tender
currency, the while they diligently fostered a public
sentiment which made it discreditable to the honesty
and ruinous to the credit of any California retailer
who should attempt to pay his debt to them in
the despised greenbacks. The interior storekeeper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>glowed with pride when Ephraim Smooth &amp; Company
gathered in his golden twenties, and commended
his honesty for “paying his debts like a man, in gold,
and not availing himself of the dishonest legal tender
law.” But Smooth &amp; Company paid their New
York creditors in greenbacks, and pocketed the difference.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inflation of the currency, or an increase of the
money of a nation, if it can be gradually made, need
not prove disastrous to the creditors, and must prove
a benefaction to the debtors of the world. The relation
of wages to the cost of living, whether the volume
of money in a country be contracted or inflated, practically
remains the same. It may be claimed that the
workman who receives an increase of wages, and
whose cost of living is correspondingly increased, is
no better off at the end of the year, yet economy
brings to him larger apparent accumulations, and he
is thereby encouraged to practice frugality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American mechanic who wandered to the Canary
Islands, where he received $400 a day in the local
currency for his wages, was enabled to save $100 a
day by denying himself brandy and tobacco, and but
for this dazzling inducement he might have surrendered
to temptations that would have made him a proper
subject for the ministrations of the W. C. T. U.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though an inflation of values which should be
beneficent might follow the discovery and working of
the Morning mine, clearly the first thing for the discoverer
to do was to take effectual measures to conceal
from human knowledge the extent of his discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Morning remained for some time in deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>thought, and then, rising from his seat upon a bowlder
behind the manzanita bushes, he tore into fragments
the paper upon which he had been making calculations,
and, excavating with his foot a hole in the sand, he
dropped into it and covered the specimens of gold
quartz which he had taken from the ledge, and, retracing
his steps, was soon at the copper-camp, where, in
answer to the queries of his companions, he replied
truthfully that during his absence he had not seen
a single quail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days elapsed, and, the shaft having been cleaned
out and the copper lode thoroughly exposed, Morning
took samples of it, and also of croppings of the other
lodes included in the ground located by Steel, and the
party broke camp and started for Tucson, where they
arrived early in the afternoon of the second day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making an appointment with Steel for that evening,
Morning deposited his copper samples with an assayer,
and, walking to the Court House, he filed the notice of
location of the Morning mine with the county recorder.
Two hours later he had the report of the assayer upon
the copper samples, showing an average of twelve per
cent of carbonate copper in the ore. This was not so
rich as had been predicted by Steel, but was of sufficient
value to warrant the purchase of the copper
prospects at the low price which had been fixed upon
them, provided that arrangements could be made for
economically working them, and Morning had already
formulated in his own mind a plan of action by which
the working of the copper lodes could be made to advance
his project of working the gold lode so as to
conceal the extent of its yield.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Morning calculated that the amount of money needed
for labor, supplies, machinery, and buildings, to work
the mines in accordance with his plans, would be about
$300,000, and his first thought was to obtain this
money by breaking down, and shipping to reduction
works in California or Colorado, about thirty tons of
the quartz before he should commence the work which
he projected for the concealment of the ledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his own hands he could mine and sack such
an amount of ore in a fortnight, and with the aid of
half a dozen pack animals, managed by himself, transport
it a mile or two from the rift, where it might be
thrown into the channel cut by the waterspout, and,
with a blast or two, be covered with rocks and dirt until
teams should be brought from Tucson for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this idea uppermost, he sought the freight
agent of the railroad company of Tucson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he came in contact with the system in vogue
on the Pacific Coast—and possibly elsewhere—that of
a one-sided railroad partnership with the producer, on
the basis that the producer furnish all the capital and
suffer all the losses, the railroad company providing
neither capital, experience, nor services, but taking
the lion’s share of the profits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What,” said Morning, “will your freight charges
be for three car loads of ore to Pueblo or San Francisco?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What kind of ore?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gold-bearing quartz in sacks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does your ore assay?” inquired the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has that got to do with it?” questioned
Morning sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Everything,” answered the official. “We charge
in car-load lots $12 per ton to San Francisco, or $24
per ton to Pueblo, and $2.00 per ton in addition for
each $100 per ton of the assay value of the ore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” said Morning, “I believe I will ship
thirty tons to San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you it here?” said the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not be ready for some weeks yet,” replied
Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did not mention its value,” said the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will state its value at $100 per ton,” said Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said the agent, “we will take it at that,
subject, of course, to assay according to our rules by
the assayer of the company at your expense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t know that I care to trouble the assayer
of your company,” replied Morning. “In fact,
the ore is a good deal richer than $100 per ton. But
I will ship it at that valuation, and release the company
from all liability for loss or damage beyond that.
In brief, I will take all the chances, and if the ore shall
be lost, or stolen, or tumbled off a bridge, or overturned
into a river, the company will only account to me for
it at $100 per ton. I suppose that will be satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The agent shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks as if it ought to be satisfactory,” said he,
“but my orders are imperative. The ore must be
assayed, and you will have to pay two per cent of its
value.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this,” replied Morning, with some heat, “is
unreasonable and outrageous. If the tax of two per
cent is to be regarded in the light of a charge for insurance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>I am sure there is not a marine or fire insurance
company in the world that would charge one-fourth
of one per cent for such a risk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Company’s orders,” said the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you wire headquarters at my cost, and say
that David Morning wishes to ship thirty tons of gold-bearing
quartz from Tucson to San Francisco, at a valuation
of $100 per ton. Say that he will prepay the
freight, and load and unload the cars himself if permitted.
Say that he does not wish the railroad company
to take any of the risks of mining, transporting, or reducing
the ore, nor to share any of the profits of the
business. Say that he will release the company from
all liability even for gross negligence or theft, beyond
$100 per ton. Say that he does not wish to acquaint
the company’s assayer or the company’s freight agent
with the value of the ore, or permit either of them to
form any accurate judgment for speculative or other
purposes as to the value of the mine from which the
ore was taken. Say that he wishes the privilege of
conducting his own business in his own way. Say
that if the railroad company will kindly fix a rate at
which it will consent to carry the freight he offers,
without sticking its meddlesome, corporate nose into
his business, he will then consider whether he will pay
that rate or refrain from shipping the ore at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Morning,” said the agent, “if I were to send
such a telegram as that, it would cost me my place, and,
indeed, my orders are not to communicate remonstrances
made by shippers at the company’s rules, except
by mail. Of course you can send any message
you like over your own name to the head office, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>I can inform you now that they will only refer you to
me for an answer, and I can only refer to my general
instructions, and there the matter will end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” replied Morning, “I will ship the ore by
ox teams or not ship it at all before I will submit to
the injustice of your general instructions. I suppose
I am without remedy in the premises?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might build another road, Mr. Morning,”
said the agent, with a slight tinge of sarcasm in his
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning answered slowly, as he turned away:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may conclude to do so, or to buy up this road,
and if I do I will run it on business principles that
shall give the shipper some little chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When will that halcyon hour for the public arrive,
Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By and by,” rejoined our hero, “and then you
may look for better days.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Forty-five years ago, doctor,” said Professor
John Thornton to his friend, Dr. Eustace, “do you
remember that, as barefooted boys, we fished for pickerel
together in this very pond, and from this very
spot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And caught more fish with our bamboo poles and
angleworm bait than we appear likely to capture to-day
with this fancy tackle,” remarked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everything about this lovely little lake seems unchanged,”
resumed the professor, “but elsewhere the
great world has indeed rolled on. Then there were
less than one hundred millionaires in this republic—now,
doctor, there are more than eight thousand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then,” said the doctor, “we came here in a
rickety old stage wagon, and we were ten hours in
making the same journey which to-day we achieved
in an hour while seated in a parlor car. Then the
telegraph was in its infancy, the electric light was unknown,
the great manufacturing cities were unconstructed,
the petroleum of Pennsylvania and the gold
of California and Australia were undiscovered, the
great Western railroad lines were unbuilt, and the web
of complex industries with which the land is now
laced was unspun. The victim of a raging tooth or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>crushed limb was compelled to suffer without relief
from chloroform or ether, and it was a crime punishable
with social ostracism to question the righteousness
of human slavery, the curative virtues of calomel,
or the beneficence of infant damnation. I never could
think, John, that the good old times, whose loss you
are always bemoaning, were nearly so comfortable
times to live in as those amid which we now dwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Eustace,” said the professor, “you attach
undue importance to a few physical comforts and
conveniences. If our fathers lacked the advantages
of our later civilization, they were also without its
vices. In the good old times which you deride,
wrecking railroads, stealing railroads, and watering
stocks were unknown. Senatorships and subsidies
were not procured by bribery; the legislator who sold
his vote made arrangements to leave the country, and
bank burglars and bank defaulters kept, in the public
estimation, the lock step of fellow-criminals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what, in your opinion was the cause of
our descent from this high estate of public virtue
and whale-oil lamps?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The main cause, Dr., of the corruption of the
human race everywhere,—gold. It was the gold
of California that revolutionized the finances, the
business methods, and the morals of the nation.
After the year 1849 the advance of values, the aggregation
of wealth, the increase of population, and the
magical growth of the West, made additional facilities
for inland travel and transportation a necessity. This
necessity caused the rapid construction of new lines of
railroad. The differences and difficulties of local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>management suggested the advantages of consolidation—and
then the reign of the centripetal forces commenced.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But all the millionaires of the country are not
railroad men, John.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Concentration of capital began with them, doctor,
and their example was soon followed by others. The
Civil War broke down local prejudices, made East and
West homogeneous, introduced communities to each
other on the battle-field, obliterated State lines, and
made individual effort in business, in finance, in manufactures,
and even in politics, less advantageous to
the individual than participation in aggregated effort,
where his gains were increased, though his personality
was submerged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have always thought that our civil war was a
moral education to this people and to the world,” remarked
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“War was an educator,” conceded the professor,
“yet the tree of knowledge with its crimson leaves
yielded evil fruit as well as good. The moral nature
of the American people has, I fear, reacted from the
tension of generous and patriotic sacrifice which war
evolved. Some of the very men who helped to strike
shackles from black slaves have been busy ever since
forging other shackles for white slaves, and in twenty-five
years from the days when we freely paid lives and
treasure to preserve the existence of the nation, and
free it from the wrong of slavery and the rule of a slave-holding
oligarchy, we have passed under the sway of
other despots, more selfish, more sordid, more relentless,
and more rapacious of dominion. The dusk-browed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>tyrant of Egypt has been overthrown, but in
his place Plutus reigns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grant you,” interposed Dr. Eustace, “that the
wealth owners are the rulers of our later civilization,
but, so far as I have observed, instead of endeavoring
to curb or overthrow them, we are all doing our
best to join their ranks and participate in their power.
You appear to be the only living millionaire who declaims
against his class. I know of no other man who
is brave enough to defy the power of money, great
enough to ignore it, or strong enough to resist its influence,
and I dare say you would change your views
if you were to lose your millions. We all defer to the
plutocrats. The Spanish nobleman who, for his ancestor’s
services, was permitted to remain with his head
covered in the presence of his sovereign, would have
been sure to take off his hat if he had entered the office
of the president of a country bank, with a view of
negotiating a small loan on doubtful security. There
was a great truth inadvertently given to the world in
the programme of a Fourth of July procession, wherein
it was announced that the line would end with bankers
in carriages, followed by citizens on foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This subservience to King Gold, and pursuit of his
favors, must cease, Dr. Eustace, or this republic will
be lost. The people must be taught to assume a more
independent and manly attitude toward the owners of
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, John, money is so necessary, and it is so hard
to turn one’s back upon it! This way lies comfort,
ease, luxury—that way deprivation and sacrifice.
This way ‘the primrose path of dalliance trends’—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>way ‘the steep and thorny road.’ This way the
wife and children beckon and sue for safety and peace—that
way only rocks, and bruises, and hunger, and
loneliness summon. What wonder that the Christ,
voicing the cry of the human to the infinite Father,
placed as the central thought of the Lord’s prayer the
words, ‘Lead us not into temptation’! But, John,
honestly now, do you think the eight thousand millionaires
you rave about are such an utterly bad lot as
you make them out to be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Individually I dare say they are good husbands,
fathers, and neighbors,” replied the professor, “but
they conceal their selfishness and rapacity, and exercise
their despotism from behind the shields of corporations
which they create and govern, and tyranny is none the
less tyranny because it is decreed not by kings, but
by entities which fear neither the assassination of man
nor the judgment of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor, pardon me, but you generalize a good
deal, and I fear somewhat loosely. It would make a
difference to me, in my feelings, at least, whether I
was knocked down by a ruffian, or by an electrical
machine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor, your simile was not considered as carefully
as are your prescriptions. If the machine be guided
by the ruffian, what matters it whether you be struck
by his hand, or with an electric current directed by
his hand? If our great newspapers, which are influential,
which claim to be independent, and which
ought to be free, are restrained from publishing articles
advocating postal telegraphy, or criticising the management
of a news corporation, what matters it that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>freedom of the press is choked by a board of directors
rather than a government censor? If the citizen dare
not give voice to his views on public affairs, what
matters it whether his utterances be choked by the
knuckles of a king, or the polite menaces of an employer?
If the voter cast his ballot against his own
convictions, and in accordance with the will of another,
what matters it whether he be coerced by a soldier
with a musket or a station agent with a freight bill?
If the settler lose his land, what matter whether the
despoiler be a personal bandit armed with a rifle, or a
corporate robber equipped with a land-office decision?
If capital exempt itself from taxation, and place the
burden of sustaining government upon the broad
back of labor, will it alleviate the pain of the load to
know that it is not the law of feudal vassalage but of
modern politics which accomplishes the exaction?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hallo! I have a bite! Ah! ha! my boy, your
eagerness to swallow that minnow has brought you to
grief!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the speaker lifted a twenty-ounce pickerel from
the placid waters of Nine Mile Pond, and deposited it,
struggling and shining, upon the green turf at his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, John,” inquired the doctor, “what are you
going to do about it all?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will have him split down the back and broiled
for luncheon,” replied the professor absently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Broil who?” queried the doctor, “Jay Gould?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? No; the pickerel I mean, though I am not
sure that similar treatment might not be accorded to
Gould, with advantage to the country.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“You ask,” continued the professor, “what shall be
done about it all? The wealth owners themselves
should be able to see that existing conditions must
sooner or later find cessation either in relief or in revolution.
Monopolies in transportation, intelligence,
land, light, fuel, water, and food—all concealed in the
impersonality of private corporations—now sit like
vampires upon the body of American labor, and suck
its life blood, and they have grown so bold and so
rapacious that they even neglect to fan their victims
to continued slumber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, John, you seem to have an attack of anticorporation
rabies. You talk like a sand-lot politician
who is trying to sell out to a railroad company.
What is the matter with you? What have these
much berated entities done?” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Done?” replied Professor Thornton. “What have
they not done? They have torn the bandages from
the eyes of American justice and fastened false weights
upon her scales. They have turned our legislative
halls into shambles where men are bought and honor
is butchered. They have written the word ‘lie’
across the Declaration of our fathers. They have
struck the genius of American liberty in her fair
mouth, until, with face suffused with the blushes and
bedewed with the hot tears of shame, she turns piteously
to her children to hide if they cannot defend
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Thornton,” ejaculated the doctor, “your
remarks would be admirable in substance and style
for an address before some gathering of work shirkers,
organized to procure lessened hours of labor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>larger schooners of beer, but to me you are talking
what our transatlantic cousins call ‘beastly rot.’ I
deny that a majority, or even any considerable number,
of the capitalists of this country are dishonest, or
unpatriotic, or indifferent to the rights and needs of
their fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not said that they were, doctor,” replied the
professor. “Indeed, if such were the case, we might
cry in despair, ‘God save the commonwealth!’ for only
Omniscience could work its salvation. What I claim
is that it is full time for the conscientious millionaires
who love their country and their kind, to seriously
consider a situation the perils of which they are every
day augmenting by their indifference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What perils do you mean, professor? How, for
instance, would anybody be hurt or periled if I were
to become a millionaire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great fortune is a great power, doctor, and not
every man is fit to be intrusted with great power.
To-day no second-class power in Europe can negotiate
a treaty or make even a defensive war without
the consent of the Rothschilds, while in America the
owner of fifty millions is more powerful than the
president of the United States, and the owner of ten
millions more influential than the governor of a State.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so he ought to be,” interposed the doctor.
“The man who can by fair means make $10,000,000
is more useful to the community in which he lives than
a dozen governors of States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But look at the danger to the people, doctor, of
these great fortunes. There are ten men in the United
States whose aggregate wealth amounts to $500,000,000,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and who represent, and control, and wield the influence
of property amounting to $3,000,000,000. If
these men should choose to settle their rivalries and
combine their interests and efforts, they could about
fix the prices of every acre of land, every barrel of
flour, every ton of coal, and every day’s wages of
labor between Bangor and San Francisco. They
could name every senator, governor, judge, congressman,
and legislator in twenty States. They could rule
a greater empire than any possessed by crowned kings.
They could promulgate ukases more absolute, more
despotic, and more certain of being enforced, than any
which ever went forth from St. Petersburg to carry
desolation to a race. They could say to the laborer
in the grain-fields, ‘Henceforth you shall be reduced
to the condition of your brother in England or Scotland,
and eat meat but once a week.’ They could
say to the toiler in the humming factory or over the
red forge, ‘Henceforth you must toil twelve hours in
each twenty-four.’ They could say to every wageworker
in the land, ‘Henceforth we will take all the results
of your labor, and give you only the slave’s
share—existence and subsistence.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All you need, Professor John Thornton,” said
Dr. Eustace, “is a long beard, a woman with green
goggles and a tamborine, a fat boy with a snare drum,
and a pair of bellows in your chest, to be a Salvation
Army seeking recruits for the church of Anarch. You
know just as well as I do that you are talking nonsense,
and that the capitalists of our country would be
neither so inhuman nor so unwise as to push their
power as you indicate.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Maybe not, doctor, maybe not, but their ability
to so use their power if they choose is a menace to a
free people, and a standing inducement to disorder,
and unless the plutocrats cease their aggressions the
people may invoke the motto, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salva republica suprema
lex</span></i>,’ and tax all great fortunes out of existence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What aggressions do you refer to, professor? For
the life of me I cannot see that this country or this
people have any just cause of complaint. The census
returns of 1890 show that in the preceding ten
years there was added to our national wealth, values
amounting to nearly $20,000,000,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The census returns tell only a part of the story,
doctor. The cottages of the land will tell you that
while as a nation we may have grown of late years
very rich and prosperous, yet among the individuals
composing the nation its wealth is possessed and its
prosperity enjoyed within a very narrow circle. The
value of all the property in the United States in the
year 1890 was $66,000,000,000. Do you know that
$40,000,000,000, or sixty per cent of the wealth of
America, is owned by less than forty thousand people?
Do you know that in the last twenty years the laborers
of the United States have added to the general
wealth of the nation, values amounting to $30,000,000,000?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what is there to complain of in that fact?”
questioned the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The complaint is that the money has not been
divided among the ten million workers who earned it.
The complaint is that it has not furnished each of ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>million households with a $3,000-shield against the
assaults of poverty. The complaint is that as fast as
created it has been seized by the centripetal tendency
which now dominates our civilization and hurried into
the strong boxes of ten thousand Past-Masters of the
art of accumulating the earnings of other people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The complete answer, professor, to your diatribe
is that the accumulations of which you speak are not
the earnings of other people. The greater portion
of this wealth has been developed from the bounty of
nature in ways which could not have been pursued
without large combinations of capital.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a mere assumption, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all, professor. The money taken from
gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, and coal mines, has
come from the treasure vaults of nature, and has not
been filched from the earnings of anybody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mining is the one exception to the rule, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon, professor, but it is not. Another
avenue to wealth has been the organization and
reorganization of great industries on unwasteful and
remunerative principles. For instance, the beef and
pork packing establishments of the West supply the
retail butchers of the land with meat at a less price
than is paid for the live cattle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where, then, doctor, do these philanthropists of
whom you speak make their money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They make it, professor, by scientific utilization of
the hoofs and horns, bones and blood, which in small
butcher shops are necessarily wasted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You believe, then, in the rightfulness of monopolies
and trusts, do you, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“John, there are no monopolies. No restrictions
are placed by law on any man who chooses to embark
in any reputable business. As for the much-abused
‘trusts,’ they have all resulted in higher wages and
more constant employment to the workman, and
lower prices and better goods to the consumer. I
suppose you will not claim that the capitalists alone
are responsible for all the crime and pauperism of the
land?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied the professor, “for the ignorant and
vicious poor play into the hands of the selfish and
vicious rich, and between the two the honest and industrious
body of the people is being ground as between
the upper and nether millstone. Indeed, I do
not know which is the greater curse to the country,
the stock thieves, whose dens are under the shadow
of Trinity Church spire, and who combine to corrupt
courts, juries, and legislators, or the dynamiters and
anarchists who would involve the innocent and the
guilty in one common wreck of social order. I hope I
am no senseless alarmist, Dr. Eustace, but I am sure
we must have relief, or there will be national ruin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“From what source, professor, do you expect relief
to come?” inquired the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frankly, I don’t know,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe your next National Convention will relieve
the situation,” insinuated the doctor, slyly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure that relief will not come,” said the professor,
“from existing political parties, whose orators
grow earnest and belligerent over the ghosts of
dead issues, and travel around and around over the
same path, like an old horse on an arrastra, forever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>going somewhere and never getting anywhere, neither
knowing or caring whether he is grinding pay rock
or waste rock, conscious only of the whip of his driver,
and hopeful only of his allowance of barley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, John, I thought you were a devoted partisan,”
said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you?” was the retort. “Well, you were
mistaken. What can be hoped from political parties
when legislators who are not free from suspicion of
venality are voted for and elected year after year, because
Grant captured Vicksburg, or Lincoln issued a
proclamation of emancipation, or Stonewall Jackson
was killed more than twenty-five years ago? Must
the people forever submit to the rule of brawlers, and
vote sellers, and trust betrayers, because such men
hurrah for some flag which other men once carried
into battle? Must the masses lie down in the path of
Juggernaut and invite him to crush them, because the
evil-visaged god parades his devotion to party issues
which were long ago remitted to the limbo of things
lost on earth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The people will right all the evils of which you
complain, professor, so soon as they see that it is to
their interest to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can they doubt that it is their interest to
right them? It is they who suffer both in purse and
pride for every unjust exaction and every dishonest
evasion. The poorest do not escape the consequences;
it all comes out of their toil in the end. It
depletes their pockets in a hundred unobserved ways.
They pay for it in enhanced taxation of their homes,
in the fuel which cooks their food, in a greater cost of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the necessaries of life, in a higher rent, in the nails
which hold their houses together, and in the increased
cost of the blows of the hammer which drives them.
I do not need to tell you, doctor, that labor must bear
the burdens of the State. Labor at last pays all and
capital pays nothing—all burdens of government, all
expenses of courts and juries, and prisons and police,
all cost of armies and navies. The diamonds which
glitter upon the shirt front of the purchased legislator,
the wine which hisses down the throat of the lobbyist,
the steel doors and locks which guard watered stock
and stolen bonds, the very powder and bullets which
shoot out the life of maddened and insurgent labor, are
all paid for out of the toil of the laborer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“While there is much truth in what you say, professor,”
observed the doctor, “yet where is the immediate
necessity for you to work yourself into such a
state of mind about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your remark, doctor, is a representative one,”
replied Professor Thornton, “and the general indifference
which it expresses is the most discouraging
feature of the existing situation. Like the villagers
who cultivate their vineyards at the base of Vesuvius,
we heed not the rumblings of the volcano. Like the
citizens long resident in Cologne, we scent the tainted
air without discomfort. We cry with the French
king, ‘After us the deluge,’ and we seem to care
very little what may happen so long as it shall not
happen to us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is the mate to your pickerel,” said the doctor,
as he landed a fish upon the grass at his feet.
“Two of the millionaires of Nine Mile Pond have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>succumbed to their own greed and the patience and
cunning of intelligent labor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Many of our millionaires,” resumed the professor,
not to be driven from his theme, “and some of the
most active and powerful of them all, are as selfish, as
rapacious, as arrogant, as ignorant, as corrupt, and as
despotic as Russian Boyars or Turkish Bashans. At
the same time they are unaware of their danger, are
utterly obtuse to their social and moral responsibilities,
and conceited with the invulnerable conceit of
self-made men. They do not seem to recognize
that they are unprotected by an army, or a strong
government, or spies, or the machinery of despotism,
or any traditions or practices of rule, and they
appear to take no thought of the infinite possibilities
of disaster which line the path of every to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You really fear, then, the fulfillment of Macauley’s
prophecy, professor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What thoughtful man does not? There is in
every large city of our land a multitude unindustrious,
unfrugal of life, uncurbed of spirit, undisciplined,
uneducated, fretful of small gains, accustomed
to freedom of speech and action, jealous of anything
which looks like oppression or class rule, unaccustomed
to restrictions of any kind, irrreligious, materialistic,
discontented, idle, envious, and often drunken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In brief, a powder magazine,” said the doctor.
“Great cities have always presented the same problem
to rulers, yet civilization lives, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because,” rejoined the professor, “in monarchial
Europe the magazine is guarded by trained armies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and watchful sentinels, while in our country it is left
open and unguarded, and anarchists with lighted
torches pass to and fro. In Europe the train of government
is built of carefully-selected materials, it is
officered by experienced engineers, and at every station
the testing hammer rings against the wheels.
Here we put in any piece of crystallized iron for wheel
or axle, and give the control of the engine to any
loud-voiced braggart who can climb into the cab, or
any ambitious dotard who chooses to hire the tricksters
of the caucus to hoist him there. Then we
throw the brakes off, the throttle-valves open, and
go screaming down the grade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how do you propose, John, to avoid a smash-up?”
queried the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall have passed the danger point,” replied
the professor, “and entered upon an era of safer and
better life for the republic, only when the great millionaires
of America shall elect to consider themselves
not merely as conquerers on the field of finance, entitled
to the spoils of victory, but as trustees for humanity,
as suns whose mission it is to draw the waters
of affluence from overflowing lake and stream, not to
hold those waters above the earth forever, but to distribute
them in bounteous and fertilizing showers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you suppose, John Thornton, that the
people would either appreciate or respond to such seraphic
unselfishness on the part of your regenerated
and beatified millionaires?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Eustace, let me tell you that when the great,
industrious, intelligent, patriotic body of workers shall
be made to feel that there is no necessary conflict between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>labor and capital, —when they shall be made to
know that any considerable number of our millionaires
are seeking further wealth not merely to add to their
personal luxury and power, but in order that labor
may be helped in turn to higher planes of life, when
it can be said truthfully—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

      <div class='line in2'>And the poor man loved the great’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In that day professional labor agitators will lose their
vocations, the workingman who never works will
be without influence among his fellows, and the
brotherhoods of beer and brawling which infest the
purlieus of our larger cities, and clamor for bread or
blood—meaning always somebody else’s bread or
somebody else’s blood—will find occasion to disband.
I do not despair of relief, I know that it must come.
Whether it shall come through ‘a preserving or a
destroying revolution,’ whether it shall come in
wrath or in peace, is a question which the capitalists
of this country must answer and answer speedily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“John, you dear old dreamer,” said the doctor,
“I know of one millionaire whose gold has not corroded
his humanity. I hope there are many such, but
I fear that if the world looks to its wealth owners to
lead it in a crusade of unselfishness, it will wait a long,
long time. But I do not diagnose the disease as you
do. You resemble a boy who has stubbed his toe.
To him there is no world and hardly any boy outside
of that sore toe. Yet if the cure be left to nature, in
time the pain will abate and the toe recover. I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>not believe that any law framed by man can make a
pound of flour out of half a pound of wheat, or that
any scheme of government can equalize the inevitable
inequalities of human life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you do not believe in the wisdom and beneficence
of compelling the rapacious rich to aid the
deserving poor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I believe in the wisdom and beneficence of
exact justice. I believe that the skillful and rapid
bricklayer is entitled to higher wages and greater opportunities
of employment than his stupid and slothful
associate, and that to deny the former his rightful advantage
is an outrage upon justice, whether such outrage
be perpetrated by an employer or a trades union.
I believe that every man is fairly entitled to all the
fruits of his labor, his skill, his good judgment, and his
good luck. The pickerel at your feet came by chance
to your hook and not mine, and therefore it is your
fish and not my fish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But by the law of nature, doctor, there is no difference
between a beggar and a king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is where you are wrong, professor. The
law of nature is a universal statute of equality of opportunity
and inequality of result, and man distorts
her purposes and violates her statutes when he places
an unearned crown on the head of a king, or an unearned
crust in the mouth of a beggar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think, then, that man has no excuse for
his shortcomings, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has many. He is controlled by the occult
power of race transmissions, by laws which he did
not help to make, by customs which he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>help to form, by organizations and environments beyond
his power to change or combat. But because
of these he should have no license to plunder his
wealthier neighbor, for, in this republic, it is within
the power of the people to change laws, and alter customs,
and secure to every man the result of his own
toil and skill—and that is all any man is entitled to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the wealth owners, doctor, have monopolized
nearly all the resources of nature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense. There is not a hungry idler in the purlieus
of New York City but might catch fish enough
at the nearest wharf to keep him from starvation, or
find within a day’s walk a piece of land he could
cultivate on ‘shares.’ The resources of nature are
inexhaustible. If every adult male in the land were
to build for himself a marble palace, there would
be no perceptible diminution in nature’s supply of
marble. If every farmer were to devote his energies
and his acres to the production of wheat, until enough
wheat should have been harvested to feed the world
for five years, yet the capacity of soil and sun, water
and air to produce more wheat would be neither exhausted
nor impaired. For thousands of years the
men of every civilization have been hewing forests,
and smelting iron, yet the forests which are untouched
and the mines which are unopened are practically
limitless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor, a man cannot stir the earth without a
spade, or cut down a tree without an ax, or mine iron
ore without a pick, and the owners of the spades, and
picks, and axes, exact from the laborer an undue share
of his labor for their use.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Who is to determine whether the share exacted
be an undue one? My own opinion is that the laborer’s
share of results has grown larger, and the capitalist’s
share smaller, during the last twenty years. At
least, the rate of interest on money is not much more
than half what it was before the war. But whether
this be so or not it is not nature’s fault. Nature is
not only implacably just, she is impartially generous.
No suitor is denied the chance to gain her favors, and
none is refused any favor he may have earned. There
are floods and tornadoes, frosts and fevers, burning
suns and chilling winds. Yet these, as well as the
fruitage and the harvests, are the offspring of inexorable
law, and science now interprets the law. It warns
us of cyclones ten thousand miles away; it predicts
the date of arrival, speed, and duration of hurricanes;
it brings the ladybug from Australia to combat
and destroy the scale-bug in California; it promises
to conquer drought by exploding dynamite bombs
in the air or by chemical production of rain; it restrains
floods by diverting rivers; it destroys malarial germs
by planting groves of eucalyptus; it analyzes soils; it
selects seeds; it fertilizes with electric wires, and it
ploughs and plants and harvests fields with iron-limbed
and steam-lunged servants. A hundred years ago
one man with spade and sickle slowly wrested from
the earth the sustenance for his little household, with
only sufficient surplus to scantily compensate the
weaver, who, with hand loom, constructed a few yards
of cloth between daylight and dark. Now a girl
guides the spindles and shuttles and makes thousands
of yards of cloth in a day, and the labor of one man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>industriously applied to so much land as he can advantageously
cultivate with the aid of improved machinery,
will in one year produce one thousand bushels
of wheat, or their equivalent in agricultural products—enough
to feed fifty men for a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grant you, doctor, that the production of wealth
has greatly increased. The problem of the hour is
how to provide for a more equal and just distribution
of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“John, the solution of the problem is not difficult.
Allow every man to have that which he earns, and
compel every man to earn that which he has. Accord
every man the opportunity to work or starve,
with the assurance that for his work he will receive
full value, and for his idleness a hunger that no public
or private charity will alleviate. Hard labor and hard
fare for the criminal, generous diet and tender care
for the sick, an ax or a pump handle for the tramp,
and allow no healthy man to eat his supper until he
has earned it. Consider sporadic and indiscriminate
charity as great an evil as injustice. Accord every
man his dollar and demand from every man your dollar,
and give and exact shilling for shilling. Emulate
and copy the inexorable justice of nature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor,” said the professor, “I am silenced but
not convinced. The sun is getting too high for further
fishing. Come, let us go to luncheon.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Bob,” said Morning, as they lighted their cigars,
and seated themselves after supper upon the
piazza of the railroad hotel at Tucson, “the copper assays
are not up to your expectations, still I am inclined
to buy the property if I can arrange to employ
men at rates that will enable me to work it. What are
miners’ wages hereabouts?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Three dollars and a half a day for ten hours,”
replied Steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how much for unskilled laborers for road
building, wheeling, and aboveground work?” said
Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two dollars and a half; but for work of that kind
you can get Chinamen at $1.50 a day, Mexicans at
$1.25, and Papago Indians for $1.00, if you wish to
employ them, though I reckon you would have
trouble about getting white men to work with either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t wish to cut wages on miners, Bob, for
they earn all they get, but if I buy that property, there
will be a lot of road building, and grading for furnace
sites, and wheeling, and other work of the same nature,
and unless such work can be done cheaply, it will
not pay to hire miners for underground work, or, indeed,
to work the copper mines at all. I shall want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>these unskilled laborers for only a short time, and I
have especial reasons for not hiring either white men
or Mexicans, neither do I care to employ Chinamen if
I can avoid it. Could I, think you, obtain enough Indians
for this preliminary work?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plenty of them at the San Xavier reservation,
nine miles from here. I patter their lingo a little and
can get you a gang if you want them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may want to drill and blast down a lot of basalt
rock to build the foundations of furnaces and ballast
the road with,” said Morning. “Will they do that
kind of work?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, until it comes to firing the blasts. You will
need a white man for that. You will also need a
white man for blacksmith work—sharpening picks and
drills. The Indians cannot work at a forge, and they
are nervous about ‘big shoots,’ as they call them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bob, if I take those copper prospects of you at
your price, will you hire a gang of Papagoes for me,
and take them up there and work them for two or
three months under my direction, you and I sharpening
the tools and preparing and firing the blasts, I
paying you say $10 a day for your services?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Mr. Morning, I don’t quite like such a job
as that, but I am anxious to sell those copper prospects,
and I will do it. But if you are going to hire
Indian labor, I advise you to do first all the work
that you intend to do with it. I mean, it will be best
to get through with the Papagoes before you take any
white men in there, or else there may be a row, and
the white men will drive away the Indians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Bob, I will take your advice. You may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>consider the trade made. I will take your deed for
the copper locations and give you a check to-morrow
for $10,000 on the First National Bank at Denver, or
I will arrange to get you the coin from the bank here
if you desire it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your check is good enough for me, Mr. Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well. Then you can go to the San Xavier
reservation early in the morning and make a bargain
with the Papagoes for three months. Obtain forty
good men and agree to furnish them with rations and
pay them $1.25 a day. They have ponies, I suppose,
and can take their squaws along if they choose. It
will make them more contented to stay. You might
contract with them also to furnish enough cattle to
supply themselves with fresh meat. They can drive
them along, and there is now plenty of grass in the ravines.
Don’t let them come to Tuscon, for I don’t
wish the people here to know what I am doing. The
Indians can strike across from San Xavier by Fort
Lowell and meet us, or wait for us at the mouth of the
Rillito. You can return here as soon as you start
them, and we will buy teams and load them with supplies,
and drive them out ourselves. We will do all
the blacksmith work and blasting ourselves. And,
Bob, keep your own counsel strictly about everything.
I have reasons for secrecy which I will explain to you
later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Mr. Morning. I don’t clearly see what
you are driving at. It’s a queer way to open a copper
mine, but you are the captain, and I’ve known
you a long time, and whatever you say goes with Bob
Steel.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>It was three o’clock the next afternoon before Steel
returned from San Xavier. He was well known to
the Papagoes, having often purchased grain and animals
from them for mining companies with which he
had been connected as superintendent. His mission
was successful, and Manuel Pacheco, a leader among
the Indians, had agreed to have the necessary force
at the place designated on the third “sun up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuscon, although not a mining town, is a commercial
center for a dozen mining camps, and there was
nothing in the outfitting of a party of miners calculated
to attract especial notice. Two wagons and twelve
mules were purchased, with all needed supplies, and
Morning and Steel drove away to their destination,
where they met the Indians and proceeded to the
old copper-camp. After supper Morning opened the
conversation which he had determined to have with
Steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bob,” said he, “to tell the truth, I do not intend
to work this copper property at present, though I
shall need it by and by for a purpose I will not now
explain. I bought it mainly because I knew you
intended to sell it to somebody, and I wished to keep
others away from this vicinity. I have another use for
the powder and the Indians, and, if you will accept
the offer I am about to make, I have another service
for you. I selected you because I know you are as
true and as bright as your name. If you will work
with me and for me in this cañon as I require, I will
give you a salary of $1,000 a month for three years,
and at the end of that time I will pay you—don’t think
I am crazy—I will pay you $1,000,000. What do
you say to my proposition?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“You take away my breath,” rejoined Steel. “If
I did not know you so well, I should say that you had
been boozing on mescal, or were otherwise off your
nut. But you don’t talk usually without meaning
what you say, and I reckon you are in earnest. But
there is nothing that I can do to earn $1,000,000,
or $1,000 a month either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, there is,” said Morning, “as you will
agree when you know all, or at least all that I intend
to tell you! Listen: When I was up the cañon while
we were here last week, I discovered and located a
rich gold quartz lode that was uncovered by the waterspout.
It is very rich and extensive—indeed, there
are many millions in sight in the croppings. It was
through my coming here to look at your copper lodes
that I was led to its discovery, and in a certain way
I consider you have a right to some profit from it, and
I can well afford to give you a million dollars for your
services and your silence, or several millions, if you
want that much. The ledge is so rich that the first
thing to do is to conceal it. No person but myself
knows its extent or value, and I shall not disclose
these even to you. When I commence working it
and turning out bullion, people will be curious, and
they will badger you to tell them all about. The elder
Rothschild is credited with the aphorism that no man
can tell what he does not know, and if you really don’t
know the extent of the Morning mine, it will be a good
deal easier for you to baffle the curious. I propose
that you shall not look at the ledge or go into the
box cañon where it is. Will you agree to that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am agreeable!” said Steel. “I appreciate
your reasons, and, anyway, it’s none of my business.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Morning then explained to Steel the situation of
the cañon where he had found the lode, and the manner
of its discovery, but was silent as to its dimensions
or the quantity of gold contained in the rock. He
informed him as to his plan of operations, which was
to pack all the supplies and tools on the backs of the
animals as far up the cañon as it was possible thus to
go, and there make a permanent camp. The Indians
were then to carry the tools, powder, and a supply of
provisions upon their backs up to the summit of the
basalt wall near the rift, where another camp would
be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two Indians were to be left at the copper-camp,
with directions if anyone appeared there to run up
the cañon and inform Steel or Morning. Two Indians
were to be placed in charge of the permanent camp
and the animals, four Indians were to carry water in
kegs to the top of the wall for the use of the main
party there, two Indians to procure firewood and prepare
food and attend to the camp at the summit, and
thirty Indians to work at drilling holes in the basalt
at the summit on both sides of the rift, and at a distance
of about ten feet from the edge of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squaws were to be suffered to make such disposition
of their time as their social and domestic
duties and inclinations might suggest. Steel and
Morning would keep the drills sharpened at the portable
forge, which, with a supply of charcoal, would be
transported to the summit camp, and as often as the
drill holes were ready they would place and explode
the blasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was intended thus to throw rocks from the summit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>down into the gorge, and this was to be repeated
until its bottom should be covered to a depth of many
feet, and all signs of the existence of the quartz lode
obliterated. From the height of one thousand feet the
lode could not be seen at all, unless one were to crawl
to and look over the edge of the precipice, and then its
nature could not—except by an experienced miner or
geologist—be discerned from that of the neighboring
rock. The Indians below would not be apt to disobey
orders, leave their posts, and go into the cañon
amid tumbling rocks, and the general stolidity and
lack of interest of the Papagoes would lead them to
attribute the entire work to the eccentricity of their
white employer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan formed by Morning was carried into effect.
Drills of different length had been provided, and the
work was systematized. At six o’clock each morning
the Indians commenced work; from eleven to
twelve they were allowed for dinner and rest. At five
o’clock drilling was suspended, and the work of preparing
the blasts was performed. The Indians then
retired to a distance, and Morning and Steel would
explode the blasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of two months’ hard labor the rift was
filled with rock and débris to a depth of thirty feet, and
the lode completely covered from view. Morning
then made a relocation of the mine on the basalt wall
above and on the mountain side below. He located
extensions, side locations, and tunnel locations in every
direction for a mile or more, so as to completely
appropriate all approaches to the original location,
and prevent others from obtaining any vantage-ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>from which drifts might be run under his property.
He also located the necessary mill sites, the waters of
Rillito Creek, and the timber upon the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plateau where he had tethered his horses on
his first visit was, with the available adjacent slopes,
chosen as a site for buildings he intended to have constructed
for the use of the miners and their families,
and a rock and earth dam was built in the Rillito several
hundred feet above, from whence the water should
be piped to the buildings. The Indians were then set
to work constructing a wagon road to the mouth of
the Rillito.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work being completed, the entire party now
journeyed to Tucson, and the Indians were paid off
and returned to the reservation, where they doubtless
regaled their tribe with an account of the work they
had performed at the instance of the white lunatic who
had paid them over four thousand “pesos” in silver
to tumble rock into a hole. Yet it is doubtful if such
information ever extended beyond members of their
tribe, for, on parting with them, Morning presented
each worker with a high silk hat, and each squaw with
red calico for a gown, and Bob Steel made a speech
to them in the Papago tongue, and asked them to
agree not to tell the Indian agent, or any white man,
where they had been working or what doing, beyond
the statement that they had been “building wagon
road.” The Indians—naturally secretive—readily
gave the required promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having recorded his new location notices, Morning
telegraphed to San Francisco for a portable sawmill.
He loaded the wagons with a fresh supply of provisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and tools and sent them with a gang of wood-choppers
in charge of Steel to the upper camp on the
Rillito, with directions to get out logs and haul them
to the site of the proposed sawmill.</p>

<p class='c007'>While awaiting the arrival of the sawmill, Morning
visited the neighboring mining camps of Tombstone,
Globe, and Bisbee, and selected with great care—after
watching them at work and informing himself
as to their habits and antecedents—one hundred miners,
to whom he agreed to give a steady job for several
years, working in eight-hour shifts, at $4.00 per day.
He preferred and obtained married men, each man
being promised a comfortable cabin, with transportation
for his family and effects from Tucson.</p>

<p class='c007'>In ten days the portable sawmill arrived, and with
it and a full outfit of building material, tools, and
pipe, Morning, accompanied by a gang of carpenters,
was again <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for the mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was busy times at Waterspout, for such was the
name given to the new camp, for the next six weeks.
By that time the sawmill and shingle machine had
turned out sufficient material, and with the carpenters
and a number of the wood-choppers who were drafted
for the purpose, eighty comfortable board houses had
been constructed, with large buildings for shops and
offices, and a suitable edifice for a schoolhouse.
Water was piped to the little plaza about which the
buildings were gathered, and all was ready for the
miners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sawmill was now set to work getting out timbers
for a mill, and for timbering tunnels. The men
were all alive with curiosity to know where was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>mine for the working of which all these preparations
were made, but both Morning and Steel were reticent,
and those who were too pressing in their inquiries
were quietly given to understand that a continuation
of questioning might cause their services to be dispensed
with.</p>

<p class='c007'>All being ready, the teams were sent to Tucson at
the appointed time and returned with the miners and
their household effects, a number of wagons chartered
for the purpose bringing the women and children.
Twenty or more adventurers on horseback and in
wagons accompanied the party, as by this time curiosity
was all ablaze at the proceedings of Morning,
whose location notices had been read by hundreds,
and been made the subject of frequent comment in the
Tucson papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous prospecting parties were dispatched to
the Santa Catalinas during the next few months, and
their members climbed all over the mountains, examined
Morning’s location monuments, and returned
to Tucson with the report that the Colorado man
was clean crazy, that there was not a sign of quartz,
or any place where quartz could exist, and that
Morning’s friends—if he had any—would do well to
appoint a guardian for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of production upon which Morning had
settled was to extract sufficient gold to gradually substitute
that metal for paper, or to make it instead of
bonds or credits the basis for paper money in all the
civilized world, and to increase the circulation of all
countries to the volume <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</span></i> of the country
having the largest amount.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>He learned from the statistics with which he had
supplied himself that the money circulation of France,
the most prosperous and the most commercially active
nation in Europe, was $42.15 <em>per capita</em>, of the
United States $24.10, of Great Britain $20.40, of Italy
$16.31, of Spain $14.44, and of Germany, $14.23. In
the Asiatic, semi-Asiatic and South American countries
the money circulation was still less, being but
$5.20 <em>per capita</em> in Russia, $3.18 in Turkey, $4.02 in
British India, $4.90 in Mexico, $4.29 in Peru, $1.79
in Central America, and $1.29 in Venezuela.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning noticed that the greater the money circulation
of a country, the greater the civilization, prosperity,
and refinement of the people; and metallic
money, or paper currency calling for metallic money,
being the best money, it would be sure wherever obtainable
to drive out all other currency. He proposed,
therefore, to increase, as rapidly as was possible,
the metallic money of the United States and Europe
to the standard <em>per capita</em> of France, beginning with
the United States, following with England, and then
proceeding to the Continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of accomplishing this was to be exceedingly
simple. He would ship gold bars to the
mints of the country whose currency he proposed to
increase, and ask that they be coined into the money
of the country. The coin received he proposed to
deposit in the banks of that country for investment
or use therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one danger against which he had to provide
was demonetization of gold by the nations. He could
only effectually guard against this by withholding all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>knowledge of the extent of his mine until he should
have accumulated a vast deposit of gold bars—say
$2,000,000,000 worth—and then deposit these for
coinage suddenly and simultaneously at the mints of
the world before any law could be enacted depriving
gold of its quality as a money metal. Yet it would
take several years for the mints to coin so large a sum,
and in the meantime gold might be demonetized. In
order for Morning to place his gold beyond the reach
of such legislation, it was essential to have it coined,
or put in form of money having a legal tender value.
A slight change in the currency and coinage laws
would effect this. In the United States it might be
accomplished by an act of Congress requiring the
government to receive gold bars, and to issue legal
tender gold notes thereon, without actually coining
the gold at all. The mints of the United States,
working to their full capacity on gold alone, could
not turn out more than $50,000,000 in coin per month,
while a government printing press could issue $500,000,000
in a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning concluded that one of his earliest duties
would be to visit Washington while Congress was in
session, and promote the necessary legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the gold which he produced he could ship to
the mints openly about one bar in twenty-five. The
other twenty-four bars he could keep at the mine until
he could build a smelting furnace and manufacture
pigs of copper, which should be hollow, and in which
gold bars should be concealed, and thus shipped to
financial centers, where they could be stored ready
for any occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Morning estimated that the production of $100,000,000
per month would require the activity of two
hundred stamps, and that with the aid of improved
machinery he could reach the ledge and commence
the production of gold in about three months. He
had now expended for labor, machinery, and supplies
about $25,000, and as much more would be required
to meet the labor expenses of the next sixty days,
while the quartz mills he proposed erecting would require
nearly $200,000 more. As the business methods
of the railroad company prevented him from keeping
his secret, and at the same time realizing any money
by shipping ore, he determined to obtain the necessary
funds by a sale of his mortgage securities, and,
leaving Robert Steel in charge of the work, David
Morning departed for Denver.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='small'>“Sick to the soul.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On his return to Denver, Morning found no difficulty
in speedily closing up his business and converting
his mortgages into money. In about ten days he
was ready to depart for San Francisco, where he
intended purchasing the necessary machinery for five
mills of forty stamps each. His sole remaining business
in Denver was the execution and delivery to the
purchaser of a conveyance of some city property
which he had sold.</p>

<p class='c007'>While breakfasting at the Windsor that morning,
his appetite was not increased by reading from the
Associated Press telegrams the following:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>“MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.</div>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Boston</span>, February 13, 1893.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“There was celebrated this morning at the residence
of the bride’s father, Professor John Thornton, in
Roxbury, the nuptials of one of Boston’s greatest
heiresses and acknowledged belles, the beautiful and
accomplished Miss Ellen Thornton, to the Baron Von
Eulaw. The happy couple will sail on the <em>Servia</em>
to-morrow, and will proceed directly to Berlin. It is
intimated that our fair countrywoman may be restored
to us after a season by the appointment of the Baron
Von Eulaw as envoy at Washington from the German
Empire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Forgotten? Ah, no! there are experiences in life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that may never be forgotten. Time rolls by, and
against the door of the mausoleum where we buried
our dead out of sight the years have piled events and
emotions and distractions, and the passion which we
once thought immortal becomes now an episode, and
by and by a dream, and at last a vague and shadowy
remembrance, and one day some new and mighty
fact stalks forward, and sweeps away all obstructions,
and the doors of the tomb are reopened, and the dead
of our heart come forth, bringing to us sometimes the
joys of life’s morning, and sometimes the bitterness
of a new death.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Morning walked from the hotel to his office
without noticing many of the friendly greetings bestowed
upon him, for his thoughts were busy with the
past, and there was a dull, dead pain tugging at his
heart strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The notary who had taken Morning’s acknowledgment
to the deed whose delivery would complete his
business in Denver, brought the instrument to Morning’s
office, and, not finding him in, slipped the paper
in the top of a desk with a circular cover. This desk
was one of Morning’s first possessions in the way of
office furniture, and, finding it convenient and commodious,
he had caused it to accompany every
change of quarters which his increasing business had
from time to time rendered necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering his office, Morning hurriedly threw back
the cover of the desk, not noticing the deed in the
top of it until it was too late to prevent the paper from
being carried by the revolving cover into the interior
of the desk, where it could only be reached by removing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>a portion of the back. The services of a
mechanic from a neighboring furniture store were
procured, the back of the desk was removed, and
Morning recovered the deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also recovered another paper. It was an unopened
letter addressed to himself, which had doubtless
reached its resting-place in the old desk through
the same process as that which carried the deed there.
The envelope was covered with dust; it was postmarked
“Boston, Mass., February, 1883”—ten years
before—and the superscription was in the handwriting
of Ellen Thornton, now the Baroness Von Eulaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dispatching the recovered deed to its destination,
Morning closed the door of his private office, and,
with breath coming thick and fast, proceeded to open
and peruse the missive. It read as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Roxbury</span>, Mass., Feb. 13, 1883.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mr. Morning</span>: This letter may bring
you a moment of surprise; if it be not a surprise mixed
with chagrin, I am less justly repaid than perhaps I
deserve for that which may seem my instability of purpose.
But I have heard you say that you scarcely
knew which was the weaker, the man who changed
his mind too often or who never changed it at all, and
in this recollection I find refuge.</p>

<p class='c011'>With men as intuitive as yourself, explanations are
almost superfluous. Nevertheless, you will bear with
me while I pass under review a few of the causes
which have led to this action.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the change in my father’s fortunes and our
subsequent removal to Boston, life began to open up
new possibilities, and what with the increased demands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>upon my time, and the many beguilements of
flattering tongues, together with—let me confess it—an
unresting desire to forget the act of folly which
had shut out every ray of sunshine from my heart, as
I found too late, I at length fixed my footing to the
artificial conditions of the situation, and for a brief time
flattered myself that you were forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>My letter, if written at all, ought to stop here. But
thus much I have learned—that passion tinctured with
sorrow is the greatest of egotists, and that the feeling
that brooks no measure of repression or discouragement
inspires a degree of courage little short of defiance.
Thus stimulated, I feel a growing joy in being
able to surmount artificial restraint and to address
you as I know you would wish an honest girl who
loves you with her whole heart, should speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>What will you think of me? Will you call me
fickle and unworthy? unwomanly? In a word, will
you misunderstand me? How could I know till my
eyes were opened that there was but one sun? that
the whole world to me was adjusted to your simple,
noble qualities? How could I know that the music
of the spheres meant the remembered tones of your
voice, that your face should haunt alike every scene of
splendor and every secret shadow, or that I would give
my patrimony to be able to pass my fingers through
your brown locks for ever so brief a moment?</p>

<p class='c011'>What am I writing? I dare not read it. How confident
I feel, how transported with the thought that
you may in remembering me forget my much-repented
dictum, or at least relegate it to the Quixotic realm to
which it belongs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>As I near the close of my letter, I am possessed with
a new fear. Shall I dare send it? What if you shall
have discovered new powers in yourself, new persons
out in the broad world, which shall make you glad of
your escape? It is so long since I have heard of you,
and life is so full of new things, I forget that you too
have quite the right to change your mind. If this be
your condition, do not, I beg of you, write me. I
could not bear the humiliation as your great heart
bore yours. Consign my letter, then, to the great silence,
and only remember me as ever and always
your sincere friend,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Ellen</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What was his colossal fortune to David Morning
now? Out of the past came this message of life and
love; of a love gone forever, and a life which now
seemed barren of purpose and hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is time but a name? The intervening years
shriveled into nothingness, and he was again bathing
in the light which shone from the eyes of the woman
he loved, the one woman on earth or in heaven for
him, yesterday and to-day and forever. Again he
walked with her under the whispering foliage along
the brow of the hill which crowns the Queen City of
the plains, and watched the burning sunsets illumine
the lavender mountains and change the clouds into
embers of glory. Again he sat beside her, reading
some tender or beautiful or stirring passage from poet
or essayist. Again, at the good-night going, he felt
her dainty kiss, thrilling his soul to ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>And she was lost to him now, lost through his pride,
lost through his vanity, lost through such dense and
inexcusable stupidity as never before possessed or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>afflicted a man. He had taken her girlish doubts as
final. He had thought to exhibit his manly pride—which
was, after all, only conceit of self—as an offset to
her presuming to question the possibility of her being
possessed by a great love for him. Coward that he
was to surrender this glorious creature without an effort.
Dolt that he was to so mistake her maidenly
hesitancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>And she—dear heart—had loved him after all. She
had condescended to summon him, and he had never
received the message. What had she thought of his
failure to respond? What must she have thought of
him, save that he was a cruel, conceited creature unworthy
of her love? What humiliation his unexplained
silence must for a time have brought to her
gentle spirit! What wreck and misery had not this
miscarriage of her missive brought to his life!</p>

<p class='c007'>If he could have identified the clerk or postman
whose carelessness had misplaced her letter, he would
have beaten him in his fury, and he wished for an ax
that he might hew and batter to splinters the inanimate
desk whose machinery had been instrumental in
wrecking two lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were they hopelessly wrecked? He caught his
breath at the thought. He at least was free, and
whatever else might come never would he be otherwise.
Never should wile of woman enchant him,
never should desire for home and love and perpetuation
of race and name beguile him. He would walk
lonely to the gates of the eternal morning, and wait
for her beyond the portal, and carry her soul upon
the pinions of his immortal love to the uttermost confines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of ether, where no entrapments or environments
of earth could follow or molest them, and in the glow
of the astral light he would claim her as his own, and
give himself to her forever and ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ellen’s letter released the passion which had been
locked for ten years in the silent chambers of David
Morning’s soul, and it possessed the man, and mastered
him with throes of bitter agony and throbs of
ecstatic delight. His cheeks were wet with the tears of
disappointment, and again to the very center of him
he laughed with joy as he covered the letter with
kisses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She loved me, my darling, my own, she loved
me!” he cried. “Maybe she loves me yet!” and
again his heart beat wildly. “For ten years she remained
unmated. But yesterday she married this
German nobleman, this Baron Von Eulaw. Surely
love could not have moved her to the union. Surely
with her nature she could not have forgotten her first
love. She was outraged and humiliated and incensed
at the silence and seeming indifference of the
man she really loved, and so she married, for reasons
common enough in society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Was this tie irrevocable? Could it not be severed?
Might it not be possible that happiness should yet be
in store on this earth for his darling and himself?
He was now in possession of the lever that moves the
world. Should he not use this power for her and for
himself, as well as for the benefit of mankind?</p>

<p class='c007'>Who was this German baron that he should stand
against him? There were hundreds of barons, but
only one owner of the Morning mine. He would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>use millions piled upon millions to bring his Ellen to
his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Napoleon divorced Josephine and married Maria
Louisa. Cæsar put away one wife and married
another. David placed Uriah in the front of the battle.
Many kings had used their power to readjust to
their liking their own domestic relations and those of
their subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a mightier king than Darius. He ruled
greater armies than any ever commanded by Bonaparte.
Not the Kaiser or the Romanoff upon their
imperial thrones could exercise so great a power as
David Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would bid his golden armies serve their master.
Walpole had truthfully said that “every man has his
price,” and the Baron Von Eulaw probably had his.
How many millions would this titled Dutchman take
for his wife? ten? fifty? a hundred? a thousand?—he
should have them multiplied again and again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning smiled grimly at the grotesque fancy.
Von Eulaw aspired to the American embassy. Mayhap
he was not covetous but ambitious. Very well,
he would ask the Hohenzollern to name his figures
for offices and ribbons and rank to be accorded to the
baron in exchange for a surrender of his American
wife. He would pay off the national debt of Germany
if necessary. Or he would buy the baron a
kingdom. There were always thrones for sale for
cash or approved credit in the Danubian country.
That of Servia was just now in the market, and even
that of Spain or Portugal might be purchased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maybe the baron loved his wife. How could he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>help loving her? Curse him, what right had he to
love her? What if Morning emulated the example
of the Psalmist and caused the Baroness Von Eulaw
to be made a widow? Money would accomplish this,
and none be the wiser.</p>

<p class='c007'>None? Ah, what of the God that rules worlds and
directs the eternities, the God that was in and a part
of David Morning, the God that punishes and pities,
the God that smote David, that struck down Cæsar,
that gave Napoleon to an exile’s death, and Henry
Tudor to centuries of infamy?</p>

<p class='c007'>If Morning gained his Ellen’s arms through wrong
to another, through wrong to his own imperial and
impartial conscience, there would be bitterness in her
kisses, and misery in his soul; they would go maimed
and chained to the gates of death, and in the other
land they should meet not again.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, inch by inch and minute by minute, Ohromades
and Ahriman fought for the soul of David Morning.
The ebon-plumed spirit of darkness and the silver-armored
essence of light battled along the lines of
heaven and hell, and the light triumphed, and darkness
was hurled from the battlements, and peace and
strength came to the aching soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>He would wait. He would not even jeopardize her
peace by righting himself in her esteem. He would
offer no explanation. He would wait, wait for the
decree of the Father, wait for the hour of meeting in
honor. If it came on earth, well; if it came only
through the help of death, still well, for “life is short
but love immortal.” In the other land there would
be readjustments, and each soul not mated truly here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>would find its true mate there, in a mating that should
be prevented by no power, and limited by no death,
but should endure so long as the planets circle in their
orbits.</p>

<p class='c007'>How did he know this? Not through any evidence
presented to the material senses, nor through any
logic of the schools. It is the spiritual sense of man
that perceives his spiritual life. No priest can give
him his intuitions, no scoffer can take them from him,
and the querulous questionings of science are but as
the babblings of infancy in the august presence of the
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>And for full five minutes David Morning sat with
his face between his hands, then rose and went forth
a conqueror.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='small'>“Conceal what we impart.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Before leaving Colorado Morning employed a force
of skilled workmen, necessary for the successful conduct
of both quartz mills and copper-smelting furnaces.
It was his design to make Waterspout a little world
in itself, the members of which should consent to remain
in the cañon for three years, communicating
with the world outside only by mail. To this end
physicians, school-teachers, and a clergyman were secured,
and a library, musical instruments, and theatrical
scenery purchased, with the confident expectation
that local histrionic talent would be developed; for
where is the American community of five hundred
souls which does not contain the material both for
Hamlet and burnt-cork opera?</p>

<p class='c007'>From Denver Morning proceeded directly to San
Francisco, where the leading iron works were soon
busy constructing quartz-crushing machinery. By the
15th of April everything was on the ground, and in
one month thereafter the stamps were ready to drop.
This result was achieved by working nights by electric
light, the Rillito furnishing power for the dynamos.</p>

<p class='c007'>In ordering the mining work Morning had arranged
for a double-track tunnel, which would reach
the lode at a depth of about one hundred and fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>feet from the surface, and there was now a broad, well-ventilated
and well-lighted underground road to and
along the entire length of the quartz lode, at a point
five feet from it. From this tunnel Morning could
cause to be run as many crosscuts into the lode as he
desired, and thus control the amount of quartz extracted,
and keep within his exclusive knowledge the
true dimensions of the mineral deposit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conjecture was rife, and the general opinion questioned
the sanity of a man who made such costly and
elaborate preparations for extracting and reducing
quartz in a place where no quartz or sign or promise
of quartz was visible. But Superintendent Robert
Steel kept his own counsel, the wages of the men
were paid promptly, all bills were cashed on presentation,
and the prevailing sentiment was voiced by big
Jim Stebbins, the boss of shift No. 3, who interrupted
and terminated a discussion among his men as to
Morning’s movements by saying:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dave Morning is no mining shark or stock-board
stiff. His money is clean money; he dug it out of the
ground; and if he chooses to buck it off agin a syenite
dike, a payin’ you fellers $4.00 for eight hours’ work,
which is a sight more than some of you is worth, why,
I reckon it’s nobody’s business but his own. It’s only
five minutes to shift time; put out your pipes, and get
a move on you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mills were built on the side of the mountain below
the tunnel, and were inclosed—as was the entrance
to the tunnel—with a high fence, within which none
were permitted except workmen on duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>A light narrow-gauge road was built from the mill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>yard at Waterspout down the cañon, past the copper
smelters, to the mouth of the Rillito. The wagon
road was destroyed, and the stream dammed in several
places, so that the only means of reaching
Waterspout was by rail; and, without a pass from
Superintendent Steel, no person was permitted to
ride on the cars. Tourists, prospectors, and seekers
for information who should overcome these difficulties,
and walk, climb, or swim to Waterspout, would need
to carry also their own provisions and bedding, for
they would find neither shelter, food, nor welcome,
and could not gain access to mine or mill.</p>

<p class='c007'>These discouragements stained the reputation of
Morning for hospitality, but they helped to keep his
secret, and proved effective against everybody except
a special reporter of a San Francisco journal, who, disguised
as a Papago Indian, journeyed to Waterspout,
and remained there several days. He might have
made a longer stay, but a Papago squaw, hearing of
his presence, sought him with a view to connubial felicity.
The reporter would have faced death for his
journal, but he drew the line at matrimony and fled.
He did not gain access to mine or mill while there,
but he picked up considerable information, the publication
of which might have proved damaging to Morning’s
plans.</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened that the sagacious manager of the great
daily, before ordering publication, frankly communicated
with Morning—who happened to be in San Francisco—and,
being persuaded by that gentleman that
the public interest would be subserved by silence concerning
the great gold mine in the Santa Catalinas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the notes of the reporter were not sent to the composing
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last all was in readiness. The men whose duties
ended with the construction of mills, furnaces, railroad,
and buildings, were sent with the teams to Tucson and
paid off. All idle, dissatisfied, and unsatisfactory men
were discharged, and their places supplied with others.
The best mining and milling machinery obtainable
was in place and ready to run. Supplies of all kinds,
sufficient for months, were in the storehouses, five
crosscuts, twenty feet apart, had been run to within
one foot of the ledge, and the doors of the treasure
caverns were ready to open, when the owner of the
mine directed that all the men assemble on the little
plaza at Waterspout in front of the company’s offices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends,” said David Morning, “I have called
you together that we may have a more perfect understanding
before entering upon the most important part
of the labor that lies before us. You have doubtless
felt surprised at the extent of the work which has been
done in this cañon without there being any ore, or indications
of ore, in sight. But your surprise will change
to astonishment when you know, as you soon must
know, how extensive and rich a body of gold quartz
is here. It has been and still is my desire to withhold
from the world any knowledge, or, at least, any accurate
knowledge, of the amount of gold that will be produced.
I conclude that the best method for securing
secrecy is to make it in the interest of all concerned to
keep the secret, and I desire to say now that each one
of you, whether miner, millman, mechanic, laborer,
teacher, clerk, clergyman, or physician, every man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>is or who may be on the pay-rolls, who shall faithfully
discharge the duties for which he was employed, and
shall remain in such employment for one year, without
in the meantime leaving this cañon, and who shall
not by letter, or otherwise, communicate any information
concerning the working or yield of the mine, will
be presented by me at the end of the year with the
sum of $5,000 in addition to his pay. Those who remain
until the end of the second year will receive a
further present of $10,000, and those who remain until
the end of the third year will receive a still further
present of $15,000. Those who choose to go, or who
may be compelled to leave here because of either misconduct
or misfortune, will receive nothing but their
pay. Should any die, the present for that year will,
at the expiration of the year, be paid to his family—if
here. If strangers visit this cañon, I shall expect
you not to entertain them or converse with them.
Those of you who correspond with friends will please
say nothing whatever as to any facts concerning this
property, or any opinions you may have about it or
about me. It is only with your co-operation and good
faith that the secrets of this mine can be kept. Any one
of you may, to a certain extent, betray those secrets.
Should he do so, he will not only defeat my plans but
deprive himself of the fortune which I expect to pay
each of you as the price of three years of work and
reticence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposition of Morning was agreed to with
unanimity, and with an enthusiasm and gratitude
which can be comprehended when it is understood
that even the sum of $5,000 represented to the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>industrious and frugal workman the savings of from
five to twenty years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days afterwards the crosscuts were in ore,
cars loaded with the yellow-seamed quartz began to
discharge into the chutes and feeders, and the music
of two hundred stamps resounded in the Santa
Catalinas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning’s estimate of the value of the ore, which
he made from the specimens taken by him at the time
of the discovery, proved singularly accurate. The
quartz contained $10,000 in gold per ton, of which
amount ninety-five per cent was saved in the mill.
The reduction power was two tons to each stamp per
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">diem</span></i>, and the yield of the mine was quite $4,000,000,
or eight tons of gold, each day. The necessity of
resting one day in seven was observed at Waterspout,
both as a sanitary measure and because of the suggestions
of the race germs that Morning had received
from his Connecticut ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disposition of the gold bars produced was
made in accordance with Morning’s plans previously
made. Each day the product of the copper furnaces,
cast in hollow moulds, was brought upon the railroad,
to the lower part of the mill yard, where were situated
the gold-melting furnaces. Under the personal supervision
of Steel, assisted by a few men specially
selected for the work, a gold bar was placed inside
each copper mould, the slight spaces filled with dry
sand, a half inch of dry sand placed upon the end of
the gold bar, and the mould then filled with melted
copper.</p>

<p class='c007'>When completed there was to all appearance a pig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of black copper or copper matte worth commercially
$18 or $20. In truth there was a gold bar worth
$40,000, which a few minutes’ work with a cold chisel
would release.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gold bars intended for open shipment were
cast one-half the size of those intended for imprisonment
in the copper pigs. Of these small bars Morning
had eight prepared each day, making the ostensible
yield of the mill and mine $160,000 per day, or
about $4,000,000 per month. Of the large bars he
had eighty prepared each day, which were shipped as
copper pigs. Their real value was about $4,000,000
per <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">diem</span></i>, or $100,000,000 per month. These were
allowed to accumulate in the warehouse at Rillito
Station until Morning should procure suitable places
for their deposit in Eastern cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 1st of August, 1893, everything had been
running smoothly for several weeks, and gold shipments
amounting to millions had been made. Morning
concluded that the running of the mill and mine
no longer required his personal attention, while his
projects demanded his presence at the great financial
centers. Robert Steel was in full possession of the
plans of his friend and employer, who, leaving everything
in his charge, bade good-by to all and departed
for Tucson to take the train for the East.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mother</span>: Really I hardly feel equal to a
detailed description of our trip over the ocean. Why
is it that I remember only the painful things about
our journey? Surely there were pleasant people,
cultivated men and graceful women, such as one always
meets in these days of free interchange between
different nations. But I have observed that some
temperaments catch first and make most visible the
shadows upon the landscape. Much as I love the
hues and tints of the changeful waters, I seem to remember
only the rolling ship, and between me and
the thought of the blue skies and the splendid sunsets
which I would have carried away as a treasured
memory, comes some trifling but harassing recollection.
So narrow and individual is the composing-stone
upon which our impressions are made up.</p>

<p class='c007'>I assume, dear mother, that you remember our
serious conversation that last night before my marriage,
as, sitting upon my couch and looking into my
sleepy eyes, you half chided me for that which you
called—for want of a better term—indifference.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Pardon me, ’tis a word with a sex. A woman
may love, she may hate, she may dissemble, but, pose
as she will, there is no profile in her passion. I do
not deny I am going to school to my own heart. I
am honestly endeavoring to follow your advice. I am
learning to love. Let me say in the beginning it is a
mistake to believe that men love deeply. If ever they
do, the object of their passion is themselves. Is this
a sound foundation to build domestic faith upon?
However, as I have said, I shall try very earnestly
to do my part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron told me this morning that as Americans
were a nation of plebeians, I would naturally
suffer many disabilities even as the Baroness Von
Eulaw, to which I replied rather hotly that honor
and courage required no purple swaddlings to hide
their proportions, and that we Americans sprang full
created from the brain of regenerate thought,
whereupon his manly fist gathered muscle for a
moment, then as speedily relaxed, and he only
slammed the door of his dressing-room between us.
Believe me, my dear mother, I was very sorry for the
scene, and I have no excuse to offer save the gaping
wound to my patriotism, which I find much more
sensitive over here than at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have constant engagements, and I feel a little
worn, though otherwise quite well. Can you pardon
a letter wholly devoted to myself? and in return will
you not tell me all about yourself, dear papa, and
everybody you know?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Daughter</span>: I have your first letter written
from Berlin, but how sad! That dreadful sea must
have made you bilious. It has always just such an
effect on your father; he sees the whole earth through
smoked glasses.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I can only imagine you as in a constant succession
of raptures. Such a marriage for an American
girl! A baron with such deportment, and such a
delightful accent! I have no doubt, too, he is much
richer than he represented. I assure you, the young
ladies of Boston’s high circles have turned all hues of
the rainbow with envy, and you ought to find great
pleasure in that recollection alone. Besides, such opportunities
as you are having to meet crowned heads,
and feel yourself as one among the titled people of Europe!
What elevation! What distinction! You
must not forget to make the most copious notes, so
that you will be able to impress your superiority upon
the world of society when you return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Really, you should be, as I know you are, very
happy. Of course “scenes” are unpleasant to one
like yourself, not foreign bred. But I am told that
such experiences are the real thing with nobility, especially
if there is an American wife. And it is reasonable
to suppose that high blood should feel intolerant
toward all forms of assertiveness on the part of
women, especially American women.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, be a little discreet, my dear, and remember
what an English woman said to you, that it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>good form to be either clever or artistic, and above
all patriotic.</p>

<p class='c007'>You speak of shadows in your life. It was only the
other day I read from one of your own books on the
Newtonian theory of color, that dark objects were
such as absorbed the light and reflected only somber
tints, and I am sure it is so with your life; it is holding
the light within itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will not write more to-day, for your correspondence
will be large, and time precious with you.
How radiant you must look with your graceful gowns
and your classic face; almost equal to a born princess!
Believe me, my dear child, I am very proud of your
noble marriage and of your dutiful conduct in making
such an one largely, let me confess, to please me.
And of all things, do not trouble yourself too much
about the love business—that will all come about in
good time, and if it does not—well, I can only say
you will have a majority with you.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greet your noble husband with the pride and joy
that I feel in him, and present your loving father, who
so seldom writes. Send fresh photos of your dear self,
the baroness, and the baron, and do not permit them
to exaggerate his nose, which is quite full enough at
best, though a true sign of the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mother</span>: So far from the monopolizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>effect of minor matters of which I complained in my
last, I seem to be losing my individuality altogether.
Have you ever possessed your mind of one subject or
object to the absolute exclusion of even yourself?
What an unpleasant condition of mind it is! The
baron I find to be a man most peculiarly constituted.
The somewhat dominant manner which you suppose
to be foreign breeding, as you expressed it, seems to
have developed into an engrossing self-consequence,
which appears to draw its vitality, if I may be pardoned
for saying so, largely from his new marital connection.</p>

<p class='c007'>For instance, at the opening of the season we attended
the Emperor’s Easter ball. According to our
customs, after concluding the first dance with the baron,
I accepted a waltz with an English nobleman, whom
I had met on some previous occasion. We were
resting for a moment after a round of the spacious
ballroom when I felt my arm seized from behind, and
with a muttered oath the baron commanded my instant
release and return home.</p>

<p class='c007'>What should I have done? Disregard him and
precipitate a scandal? Impossible. I made excuse in
some hypothetical disarrangement of my dress and
retired. I am only able to write because it is my left
arm which suffered the accident. The subsequent explanations
of the baron were, of course, frivolous, but I
was too relieved by any form of apology to add words,
which, without reference to their significance, always
irritate him. I mention this little incident in order to
show you how it is that my visible life is subordinated,
albeit my spirit is in no way depressed though severely
harassed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>As I write I am doubtful if I ought to speak of these
things at all. I do not ask myself what is due to my
rank here, for that was conferred by him, but is it
womanly to stand before the world an intelligent
and willing indorser of his character and conduct,
having given my public vows for better or worse, and
then, cowering behind his faults, denounce such acts as
only, at worst, affect me? Indeed, I must exercise
more courage and less candor. One thing is certain,
I am constantly looking for the better traits in his
nature, and am making every effort to call them forth.
Thus I escape self-reproach at least. But I am self-abashed
at my attitude, for I abhor dissembling. The
baron loves to taunt me with this trait, which he calls
rudeness, and declares it to be the result of my “Yankee
training.” I only smile at this, for, as I have said,
he cannot brook discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, my dear mamma, enough of this, for you will
think my marriage a failure, and contribute my experiences
to the building up of Mona Caird’s theories.
By the way, how shocked I felt at reading them, although
I now divine some meanings that I had overlooked!
But never can I tolerate the thought that
there are not people—ideal, if you please—whose marriages
might be too sublimated for earthly contract,
and are, therefore—according to the proverb—made
in heaven. Dear mother, pardon me, there is something
wanting in your letters. You promised me to
mention everybody we ever knew, or something to
that effect. I am absolutely famishing for news of our
old friends. By the way, how peculiar it is, I seem
to remember with singular pertinacity the people we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>knew before we came to Boston, and dear, beautiful
Denver is ever before my eyes. Please remember
everything, and above all your affectionate</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Old Schoolmate</span>: Your kind letter
makes me homesick. Can you imagine a homesick
bride? Even before fruitage appears from the orange
bloom, dismated for the decking of my nuptial robes,
or even the fragrance departed from the yellowing
buds on the garniture laid away to rest and rust, I
am sitting with an unwilling face to the open door of
the future, and groping with a blind but eager hand
among the rustling leaves of a near past, for some familiar
touch or sound to summon back the half-tasted
joys which I so ruthlessly flung away.</p>

<p class='c007'>You ask me for some advice concerning marriage,
illumined, as you tersely put it, by experience. My
sweet friend, what a useless task you impose upon me.
Whenever was woman directed by the experiences
of others, however wise or however bitter such experiences
may have been? Always some suggestion or
exception to change the verdict. “Mine has black
eyes, yours has blue, which makes all the difference.”
Or, “one is fat, the other lean.” Or, “this one walks,
the other rides”—so infinite the variety of excuses,
so single the faith of woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>What else, then, shall we call marriage but destiny?
The heart knows its wants and we know its plaintive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>cry, as a mother knows the wail of her famishing babe;
yet for some frivolous fancy or conceit, some wound
to our vanity, some plethoric ambition, or some glittering
paste or bauble, we stifle the natural cry of the
human heart, and wait for the mystic note upon which
is to be constructed the music of our future. Alas! in
the metaphor you understand so well, we too often
touch only the diminished seventh, and the sure, complete,
resolving chord is never sounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat, too, our institutions of marriage are at
fault, or at least the laws and customs which control
them. With a nation of men, free, rational, and liberal,
we have a nation of women enslaved, dishonest,
and miserable, and it is among her noblest and most
common phases of fate that she goes mutely to her
grave, a victim of such weak social prejudices as have
grown to be even a subject of satire among Europeans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conscientiousness is a boasted virtue among Boston
people of certain high cult, yet how many of her beautiful
women go to the altar with a lie upon their maidenly
lips? Why?—For the reason that there is some
man whom she loves and dares not declare it. For the
reason that society sets a seal upon her lips and turns
her life into a drain-channel for misbegotten vows.
For the reason that she cannot break the frost-bound
usages of cowardly error with one stroke of her puny
fist, and openly propose to join fortunes with the man
after her own heart and her own high convictions.
And so she rakes over the cold, unfruitful soil in her
own soul, and plants the germ of a falsehood or a folly,
and waits for the accident of some quickening power,
in slavish and unheroic patience.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Witness the result: Some masculine hand, more or
less clumsy or more or less cunning, little matter if it
bring a wedding ring, sheds ephemeral warmth upon
the unsanctified ground, and the victim starts upon
her lonely, loveless journey toward race building and
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I indicated, dear Fanny, I have not drawn for my
picture largely upon individual experiences, neither
are my opinions stimulated by any observations taken
from this side the water. Indeed, I even prefer, of
kindred evils, the insipid method which leaves the
marriage question in the hands of the parents. But
let me leave this for subsequent discussion, for my letter
is already too long, and I have not gossiped at
all, and I remember, dear girl, how you do love innocent
gossip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Write to me often and I will fill my letters with the
sweetest of nothings if you will. Love and adieu and

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dearest Mother</span>: “Let fate do her worst, there
are moments of joy,” and such moments I owe to my
fondness for music. What would have been all these
dreary weeks and months of shallow acting, if the
depths of my soul had not been stirred by the genius
of that creative force which, mocking at our own
crude disguises, rehabilitates pain with the fair seeming
of pleasure, which relegates near sorrows to the
realms of tradition, and illusionises common care?</p>

<p class='c007'>Art, in any form, I conceive to be the benefactor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of the human race. If truth, shorn of its infinitude
of possibilities, constitutes the religion of the civilized
world, if the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus et machina</span></i>, as Æschylus somewhere
has it, unlyrical and unleavened by beauty of
device, by rhetoric or action and climax, be persuasive
and instructive and inspiring, then how ineffably shall
truth have gained by the development of its powers
through visible forms of dramatic conceit, through association
with the elements of art, through characterization,
through skillful adaptation, through harmonized
mediæ of appeal to the sense or the sentiment,
the sympathies or the imagination?</p>

<p class='c007'>I am reminded here of an incident which occurred
in our box at the Grand Opera House, during a late
performance of Die Meistersinger, which resulted—as
is not unusual in these days—unpleasantly. My husband,
as you may remember, affects music solely for the
paraphernalia of the stage, for the glitter and show of
boxes and stalls, for the exposed shoulders of the diamonded
dames of fashion, for the numbers of men with
eyeglasses and uniforms—anything, in fact, but the
music, which rather bores him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore it is I apprehend that he discusses music
so incomprehensibly—to say the least—I would not
say irrationally. Somewhere during the development
of the plot I was struck with the similarity of the dramatic
motive with that of the Greek tragedies, especially
the choral odes, where occurs the element of
transition which some scholars call the evolutionary or
perhaps the re-incarnating period of the ancient
drama. This similarity—in some ways identical—I
inadvertently alluded to in a more or less critical review
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of the opera and its construction, which I ventured
between acts, in the presence of a party of
Americans who were our guests for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly as thought, the baron’s face was aflame.
But “what it were unwise to do ’twere weaker to regret,”
and I prepared to defend my position as best
became me. “You call my divine countryman a plagiarist,”
he hissed between his teeth. Our male guest
glowered, and the ladies with heightened color looked
at the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said I, with an assumed
smile, “I did not say so, though I admit that my
suggestion was unfortunate in its inference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron sprang to his feet and stood over me,
his arms akimbo and the well-known look of suppressed
rage upon his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You called my divine countryman a plagiarist,”
he repeated, gazing out over the audience, and feeling
for my slippered foot with his heel, which he settled
firmly upon my silken-clad instep. The hurt made
me wince, but I could not remove my foot from the
vise. Then, in order to mollify his temper, which I
had grown to know too well how to deal with, I added
laughingly, though half wild with pain as he deadened
his weight upon my poor instep:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“If your countryman were amenable to the charge
of plagiarism, so also is our Shakespeare, for in the
comedy of Trinummus, Megaronides says, ‘The evil
that we know is best. To venture on an untried ill,’
etc., and Shakespeare, two thousand years later, said,
‘Rather bear the ills we have than fly to others that we
know not of.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“You call my divine countryman a plagiarist,” half-childishly,
half-insanely repeated my noble lord, grinding
my foot beneath his heel. A cry of pain escaped
me, which a timely crash of cymbals in the orchestra
had the effect to drown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what of it” blurted the American, throwing
his full weight, as if by accident, against the
baron’s shoulder, and then turning to me with an
apology resumed his place. Now while I never take
refuge in my sex for at least a verbal retaliation of the
wrongs I receive from my husband, it goes without
saying that the man who visits brutality in any form
upon a woman is a coward. But I had never seen the
baron insulted, and was therefore wholly unprepared
for the profuseness with which he apologized to our
guests, and the blandness with which he offered his
hand as he bade them good-night. But the most
humiliating part of this humiliating affair was the fact
that I was forced to repeat an apology fashioned by
himself, the entire length of our journey home, even
until the carriage stopped at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not clear to me, my dear mother, that I am
justified in rehearsing to you, or to anyone, details of
my life, which may seem trivial, but for which I am
able to offer no other excuse than your own solicitous
insistence. I am always promising myself that every
next letter shall be dictated in more cheerful spirit.
Till then adieu. Present me with kindest love and beg
papa to write me. I do so long for a sight of his letters.
Love to those who love me.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Berlin</span>, June 21, 1893.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dearest Mother</span>: How shall we account for
our various moods? Yesterday I was miserable; to-day
I am joyful; to-morrow I may be hopeful or heartbroken,
according as—oh! I forgot to say I am all
alone; the baron has gone to St. Petersburg. I am
supposed to have accompanied him, and so nobody
comes. But I am not lonely; now that I am left to
myself I see how beautiful is the world about me.</p>

<p class='c007'>This morning I looked from my windows upon
the river. The sharp lights I had watched so often
swiftly changing to shadows, the warring glances suggestive
only of inner strife, with all its complexity of
passion, were lost in the soft peaceful flow of the waters
as they hurried on to the ultimate sea. And I
thought how much of this mood is due to fancy, that
untenable, mercurial, and sublimated quality of the
mind, half trickery, half truth, and altogether elusive
as vapor. But how profligate of that precious sense
of pleasure so steadily withheld from my heart these
later months! Too precious, indeed, for the operations
and experiments of the mental laboratory to which I
seemingly so recklessly submitted it, and so I dismissed
analysis and clung to my fancies, which at least
made me happy in the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>After my breakfast I prepared myself for a walk,
with only my little fox-terrier for a companion. Poor
little Boston, how grateful he seemed! I could see
him laugh with joy as his little brown lips quivered
with flexible feeling. Notwithstanding his many years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>he could scarcely find footing for his bounding steps
for looking back at me to search my laughing eyes.
You remember who gave me my terrier, away out
in Denver? how he was brought to me in two strong,
guardful arms, a little loose-skinned, wise-eyed puppy,
so quiet and serenely happy in the warm embrace—where
was I? oh, yes! talking about Boston—so we
pulled some roses, Boston and I. But never looked
roses so red, or green so tender or so vivid, and I
longed to find the secret of their voluptuous bloom
and half-suffocating fragrance, but that I guessed all
was again fancy; only an easy, translatable pinch of
dust and a resolvable stain; a simple stroke of creative
power and a dash of ether—only a rose.</p>

<p class='c007'>How easy seem the processes of nature with harmonized
material for working out the thought! Nature
never experiments; gravitation is her law, deflection
is anarchy, and defiance a destroyer. Love, I deem, is
only obedience to this law. Obscure as are its operations
and subtle as its teachings are, any smallest
portion of scholarship, leveled at the finding out, divested
of preconceived ideas and personal bearings,
but persistently and conscientiously agitated by scientific
and organized effort, might revolutionize a world
of error, and establish a sure basis for sentiment and
social reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>For I believe that unhappy marriages are a direct
result of ignorance. Passions called by various names
go to make up the system. Sordidness, vanity, interdependence,
weak abeyance to custom, contribute
to the sum of human misery. But ignorance is the
basis of the organized error. For what manner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>men or women would deliberately entail upon themselves
the shackled conditions of a loveless marriage,
which has no alternative but subordination or rebellion?
For only in love—another name for harmony—may
be found that unity which leaves no room for sacrifice
or misconceit.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, dearest mother, what can you think of my letters?
I began to tell you of my one happy day and
have spread my speculations over the whole human
race. I started to take you for a promenade along
Unter den Linden, and to rest by the cool fountain
in the Lustgarten, and have ended with a few feeble
remarks upon the possible sources of sentiment and
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Boston is waiting for his dinner, for he dines
with me to-night. What a jolly day we’ve had, eh,
Boston? and we will sleep and dream of you, dear
mamma, and many more, for none but bidden guests
must fill my room to-night. By the way, I do wonder if
the poor, weak brain of my little terrier is in any degree
susceptible of being stirred by memories of his
old friends? In any event, I envy him, for he is not
amenable to the necessities of a false life, “a liar of
unspoken lies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dear mamma, a sweet good-night. I am sending
you a few pictures picked up at Lepkes. The group I
am sure you will enjoy, though I like better the portrait
by Van Dyck. There is a haunting sort of look
about it, reminding me of someone I have known
somewhere. I wonder if you will discern it? Probably
it was only a passing fancy, one of such as have
filled my brain all day long.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dearest Mother</span>: How rebellious my heart and
impatient my pen as I take it up to write words which
only your mother’s ear should catch from my lips!</p>

<p class='c007'>Where shall I begin to tell you the history of the
past month? Really, my memory seems too surcharged
with a sense of bitterness and wrong to do me
service. But I must lead you step by step, reluctant
as I know you are to follow me behind the gilded
arras.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his return from St. Petersburg, the baron
developed more pronounced signs of jealousy than
had ever appeared hitherto. Perhaps this feeling was
stimulated by my last letter to you, which I inadvertently
left unmailed, and which he opened and read.
Suspicious husbands you know are as jealous of
moods as of men, and not to be miserable “when the
Sultan goes to Ispahan” is indeed a crime. I believe
there are few jealous husbands who are themselves
guiltless. I do not think, however, that this test applies
to my own sex, albeit I do not take refuge in the
exception—Heaven save the mark!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the baron came home, as I said, quite confirmed
in many unpleasant ways I had remarked before.
Without any apparent cause he stole about my
room in unslippered feet, and listened furtively at the
keyholes. He locked the doors whenever he passed
through, and spoke to the servants through a crevice.
Instead of his usual violence he whined his complaints
of my demeanor toward him in the weakest and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>supine fashion. But that which exasperated me most
was, and is still, his unaccountable pertinacity. He
would place his chair close by me and hold his knee
against mine, or his elbow, or his foot, while, with purpling
face and hanging mouth, he entreated me not to
leave him, until, in half insane protest, I would break
clear of him and throw open a window, or bathe my
hands and face in utter exhaustion, or—I had almost
said—sense of contamination. In his fits of rage there
is something genuine from an animal, if not from a
manly, point of view. But how shall I deal with this
new phase? Ah, well! let me get on with my letter,
for I have much to say, and that is why I am dallying.</p>

<p class='c007'>I consented to come to Mentone on account of my
health. Finding myself growing weak and failing, the
physicians ordered an immediate change, and recommended
the old cure virtually—to take myself out of
their hands. The baron loves to play, and I suspect
is a little too well known in gaming circles in Berlin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore when he proposed Mentone so early in
the season, or, indeed, altogether out of season, I—quite
knowing that it meant Monte Carlo—accepted,
and with valet and maid and dear old Boston we came.</p>

<p class='c007'>Result, financial ruin! The baron played recklessly.
Each time when I saw him he was feverish
and abstracted. I did not ask the cause, whether he
were winner or loser, for, like most women, I believe
that everybody finally loses, but I was not prepared
for the dénouement, for he has absolutely lost not only
all his ready money, but is heavily in debt, and will
need to resort to further mortgage of his landed estates.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Weak and foolhardy as he was, I pity him, for what
must have been his feelings as, driving down the Corniche
road overhanging the old sea, he reflected how
many men had sought forgetfulness for just such acts
of folly in the tideless waters. Only that the baron
has other ideas about reparation, for he came home
and first proposed that I write my father for money
to make good his losses. Taking courage from my
silence, he suggested that I cable my message at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>This latter I proposed not to do, as I informed him
in very few words. He has left the hotel in a terrible
fit of rage, vowing revenge with his last accents. And
I am writing this letter while I wait, meanwhile wondering
how much I ought to blame myself for my unhappy
life, or if I ought not to lock the secret in my
own breast, even from you, my mother. But a secret
is a dumb devil, and so long as there is another hand
to glance the dart, it rarely wounds to death. I will
mail this at once in order that it shall not fall into his
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dearest mamma, are these letters never to cease?
I think I notice that your replies are more reserved,
and I have thought full of pain and discouragement.
But do not feel discouraged. I realize the resources
within me, and I have a fund of reserved power which
I may summon in an exigency. I have not fairly contemplated
anything in the future; to deal with the
present has been my purpose. Each joy and each
sorrow in its turn, so shall no preconceived action
operate to the ends of injustice or unfairness. I close
this in haste but lasting love.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>O My Beloved Mother</span>: While I feel always
sure of your earnest sympathies, how shall I expect
you to appreciate the sentiment of horror which this
new and fiendish device for torturing my feelings visits
upon me! How can I write it?—my poor little Boston
is dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>That fact, with a few silent tears, and a day or two of
depression, I could have borne as the end of all things
mortal. But he was as foully murdered as ever was
the victim of the most infernal plot, for he was given
no poorest or most unequal chance to fight for his life,
which was as dear to him as mine to me—and that is
the least possible to be said. I am in no condition of
mind to discuss ethics, or to philosophize upon the
events which led to this tragical termination of differences,
of which poor little Boston’s life paid the forfeit.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be that I was wrong, certainly I would have
made any terms to have saved my poor terrier from
his terrible fate, few as were the years he would have
lived at most.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am not unaware that there are certain concessions,
and certain acts of graciousness, which, in a
limited sense, may properly be expected of every
wife toward a reasonable husband. Not his boasted
superiority by any means, but the fact that she is
measurably relieved from financial stress or responsibility,
constitutes an unwritten law among well-thinking
wives everywhere, I believe, and makes the demand
upon her. But I considered nothing but the enormity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of my husband’s exactions, and erred in my estimate
of the possibility of my husband’s brutality. I wish
there were a stronger word which I might politely use.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall I give you briefly the harrowing details of
this ruffianly act of cowardice? I think I told you in
my last how the baron had left the house, filled with
vindictive rage at my refusal to demand of my father
large sums of money for his gambling losses. In
about an hour he returned and renewed his proposition
with increased violence, at the same time seizing
a pen and writing a cablegram, which he commanded
me to sign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remembering that I had given him considerable
sums of money from time to time, amounting to many
thousands of dollars, I entreated him to wait for a
day, while he should make me understand the condition
of his financial affairs. This proposition he received
with the most frightful oaths. He declared
that he would take my life, and would begin by killing
my pet dog. No sooner said than done. He rushed
to the veranda, where poor little Boston lay stretched
upon his cushion asleep in the sun, and, seizing him
by the neck, he dashed him violently to the ground
below. A few minutes later my little friend was
brought to me still feebly conscious, but mangled,
bleeding, dying.</p>

<p class='c007'>How can I ever forget, who ever did who has
ever witnessed it forget that last questioning, beseeching
look of affection and dumb fright which a dying
animal turns upon the face of someone he has loved?
Is it less than human or more? Not till the mists
gathered across his pretty brown eyes was that last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>eloquent appeal swept away. “What have I done?”
“What have I done?” was the question he was asking
of me. Who shall say whether he received his answer
in some later and easier translatable speech than mine,
in some new and disenthralled state of being? Who
shall say that he did not carry away with him a love
which was all love, with no taint of selfishness or ulterior
thought, quickened by no new speculation, or tradition,
or sanction, or human edict? Who shall say
that the attributes of faith, and self-surrender, and
charity, and forgiveness, and loyalty are lost because
in one incarnation they were tongue-tied? For myself
I want to see my dogs again. They were my
loved companions, as are my books or my works of
art. And if the fire destroy them, are their contents
naught or worthless because an unlettered man could
not read them? At best an after life is a problem,
but let us put the problems together and one may
help to solve the other, for half a truth is oftenest a
lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have sought distraction in these comments, but
my sorrow returns to me, dear mother, and my eyes
are too full of tears to be able to see the lines. <em>Vale</em>,
poor Boston, and a grateful throb of gladness that I
have a dear mother to whom I can tell my grief.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='small'>“Lo! the poor Indian.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Imperfect definition and classification, followed by
hasty, inaccurate, and unwarranted generalization, are
fruitful sources of popular error. To the misinformed
or uninformed mind the Indian is a noble savage,
whose hunting-grounds and corn-fields have been
taken from him by the ruthless paleface, and who
passes his time pensively leaning upon his rifle, with
his face to the setting sun, the while he makes touching
appeals to the Great Spirit, and mourns the disappearance
of his race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the country west of the Rocky Mountains and
south of Green River, the sentimental Indian with whom
Cooper doped American literature, has absolutely no
existence. Uncas and Chingachgook never journeyed
so far westward as the Rio Grande, and prosy old
Leather Stocking, with his Sunday-school soliloquies,
and his alleged marvelous marksmanship on knife
blades at three hundred yards, would have been
elected president of the Arizona Lying Club by
acclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many tribes of Indians in that section of the country
have scarcely any belief in a future state of existence,
and no words in their jargons to represent the
ideas of gratitude, of female chastity, or of hospitality.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Their opportunities of obtaining food have been in
nowise lessened by white occupation of the land.
There never were any buffalo there, they never hunted
bears or any combative animal, the fish and small
game and pine-nuts are nearly as plentiful as ever,
and the bacon-rinds and decayed vegetables to be
found near every mining camp furnish the noble reds
with a food supply more agreeable to their indolent
habits than the hard-won trophies of the chase.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet there are Indians and Indians, as there are
Christian bank presidents and unsanctified bank robbers,
and it is as incorrect to class the devilish Chiricahua
Apache with the dirty but gentle Yuma as it
would be to similarly couple a hook-nosed vender of
Louisiana lottery tickets with a blonde-haired solicitor
for a church raffle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mountains of Eastern Arizona and Western
New Mexico, occupying a country hundreds of miles
in area, a country which, for their benefit, has been
reserved from miner, settler, and grazier, live the
White Mountain Apaches during the winter months,
when they are not “on the war path,” as their pillaging
and murdering expeditions are somewhat
bombastically designated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever may be said of other savages in other
localities, the Arizona Apaches are without a single
just cause of complaint against the government, or
against any of the Caucasian race. No cruel white
men have ever invaded their hunting-grounds, or
given them high-priced whisky in exchange for low-priced
peltry. Red-handed and tangle-haired have
these marauders and their ancestors lived for centuries
in their mountain lair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Since the United States of America became, forty
years ago, the nominal suzerain of the territory
occupied by these peripatetic “vermin ranches,” they
have been unprovoked invaders, thieves, and assassins,
and their summer raids upon the miners, teamsters,
and cattle ranchers of Arizona and New Mexico, have
been as regular as their winter acceptance of the
bacon and blankets with which a generous but mistaken
policy feeds and warms them, at a cost equal to
that of providing each savage with a suite of rooms
at a fashionable hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is but a few years since a small party of the most
vicious and untamable of these bandits, who were
captured with the scalps of their victims at their belts,
were declared by the authorities at Washington to be
not answerable to trial or punishment by the courts of
the Territory whose people they have robbed and murdered
with impunity for many years. But, partly in
deference to outraged public sentiment, and partly in
apprehension of the acts of a possible committee of
vigilance, these Indians were condemned for their
crimes to imprisonment in a government fortress in
Florida.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike white prisoners who were condemned to
labor and isolation, these tawny murderers were allowed
to be accompanied in their journey across the country
by their wives and concubines, who were transported,
fed, clothed, and made comfortable, at government cost.
Arrived at their destination, it was found, after a few
months’ sojourn, that the humid air, lower altitude,
and uncongenial surroundings of Florida, and, later, of
North Carolina, disagreed with the digestion and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>disgruntled the disposition of the noble reds, and,
upon a proper showing that their health demanded a
return to their former homes, lest confirmed nostalgia
should set in, and possibly remove them permanently
from the scene of human activities, they were surreptitiously
returned by the government to their old reservation,
where they promptly expressed their appreciation
of the clemency accorded them by breaking
out once more and heading for the Mexican Sierras,
marking their track with burning ranch houses and
murdered settlers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the summer of 1893 a party of about forty of
these Apaches, headed by the most cruel, malignant,
and treacherous of savages—the thrice-pardoned and
faith-breaking Geronimo—left the reservation for their
annual raid. The military post at Fort Lowell having
been abandoned and the troops removed in the interest
of government parsimony, the savages found it
convenient to make a detour by the valley of the Santa
Cruz, so as to cross the railroad track in the vicinity
of Tucson, and reach their mountain fastnesses in
Sonora by the Arivaca Pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>It chanced that David Morning, on his departure
from Waterspout for New York, while riding from the
Rillito station into Tucson, and riding by night, to
avoid the heat of an Arizona sun, was seen by the Indians,
who, having emerged from a defile in which
they had been concealed during the day, were now
stealthily and swiftly journeying in the same direction.
The opportunity to murder a white man was one not
to be neglected, but the report of a rifle might attract
attention and instigate speedy pursuit, so two of Geronimo’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>followers were detailed, armed only with bows
and arrows, to follow the wayfarer through the dusk,
and bring back a scalp, that might be obtained without
danger and without noise.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Morning had been riding a horse, this tale might
have had sudden ending, but he had found for his necessarily
frequent journeys between the mine and Tucson
no such convenient and comfortable mode of transportation
as a seat upon the back of Julia. The
equine in question was a large jet black saddle mule
bred at the ranch of Señor Don Pedro Gonzales,
which was situated at the foot of the mountain, on the
opposite side of the Rillito Valley, about three miles
from the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mule, as an animal, is often both misrepresented
and misunderstood. No creature tamed by
man has keener instincts or greater sagacity, or is
governed to so great an extent by intelligent self-interest.
A mule is always logical. His ordinary reasoning
is a syllogism without a flaw. A horse impelled
by high spirit, and patient even unto death, will travel
until he drops from exhaustion, and will pull or carry
without complaint a load that causes his every muscle
to pulse with the pain of weariness.</p>

<p class='c007'>But where lives the man who was ever able to impose
upon a mule? Strap an unaccustomed or unjust
load upon the back of this animal of unillustrious paternity,
and he will not move except in the direction of
lying down. Attempt to ride or drive him past his
rightful and usual resting-place, and there may be
retrogression, and there may be a circus, but there
will be no advance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In addition to his other virtues a mule has an exceedingly
keen scent. He seeks no close acquaintance
with either grizzly bears or Indians. He will get the
wind of either of his aversions as quickly as a hound
will whiff a deer, and, like the hound, he will give
his knowledge to the world, in a voice that is resonant,
magnetic, and—on the whole—musical. The bray of
an earnest mule is not after the Italian but the Wagnerian
school. It is not the sweet, tender tenor of
Manrico, it is Lohengrin sounding his note of power.
It is not, perhaps, equal to an orchestra of nightingales,
but it has a rhythm, and passion, and power, and sweetness,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quick instinct of Julia caught the scent of the
Apache assassins, and as they crept up she was engaged
in a struggle with her rider, who, with voice and
spur, was vainly endeavoring to induce and compel
her to proceed along the usual road.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Julia,” soliloquized Morning, “you must
have been browsing on rattle-weed! What is the
matter with you?”—and he tugged vainly at her
bridle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whizz! whizz! went the arrows. With one shaft
quivering in her flank, the mule fairly sprang into the
air, while the other transfixed the left arm of David
Morning, and pinned it to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then his question was answered, and he knew
what was the matter with Julia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The frenzied animal leaped the Rillito at a bound,
and swept across the valley to the corral adjoining the
Gonzales ranch house. Once within the inclosure,
she stopped and uttered her most melodious notes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>delight. With a crescendo of welcome a dozen of
her kindred greeted Julia, and the swarthy major-domo
of the ranch, accompanied by half a dozen
vaqueros with lights, rushed out, and Morning, weak
from pain and loss of blood, was half-led and half-carried
into the ranch house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Señor Don Pedro Gonzales a year before had
journeyed into Paradise, from the effects of an attack
of mountain fever, aggravated by too copious use of
mescal, and left his ranch houses and corral, his two
hundred mules and horses, his two thousand cattle,
his brand of G on a triangle, and his rancho Santa
Ysbel to his señora, the Donna Maria, who, with her
family, continued to occupy the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Messengers dispatched to Tucson returned with
physicians, who cut out the arrow and found that the
wound was severe, and its result might be fatal. They
agreed that for Morning to endeavor to travel with such
a wound would be simply suicide, and that he must
not attempt to leave the shelter and care which the
hospitable Gonzales family were glad to accord him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='small'>“It is only mirage.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A long, low, adobe building, roofed with tiles of
pottery clay, situated near the banks of the river
Santa Cruz. Long rows of cottonwood-trees spread
their branches nearly over the little stream, and the
graceful masses of pepper, combed to a fringe, drop
their courtesied obeisance to every passing breeze,
and throw their uneasy shadows well over the walls,
neatly stuccoed with cobblestones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The air curdles with the heat rising from the arid
plain, and hangs, a shimmering sheet of translucent
vapor, between the eye and the ever-lengthening distance,
which softly melts into the Santa Rita Mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is that a lake out of which rises the well-outlined
range of nearer hills? or a sea, throwing up billows of
foam and shadow, with islands of green glimpsing
their shapes in the placid waters that encircle their
feet? And ships, with well-fashioned hulls and wide-spreading
sails, and pictured rocks, and beating
breakers, and lifeboats with men tugging at the oars.
No! it is only mirage, a pretty picture written with
the electric pen of nature upon the parchment hot
from the press of her untongued fancies. In her luring
tale strong men have trusted themselves to fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>deception, and beasts, with lapping tongues, and
knotted with water greed, have gnashed their teeth at
her beautiful garments of fateful film, and lain down
to die. Art has been outvied in pictorial effects, for
she filters her shadows from daintiest clouds, and
borrows her bath of oscurial glints from the unfathomed
deeps of heaven. Even austere science hides
his forged shackles shamedly away, and turns with
unsatisfied scorn from the flitting gleam of her mocking
brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is only mirage, one of nature’s cleverest tricks;
and what more is life?” comes once and again
from parched lips and longing eyes. For, although
water, sweet and cool, drips from an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla</span></i> near at
hand, yet, stretched upon a bed carefully prepared of
finely-stripped rawhide, placed upon the well-beaten
and smooth earth, under the sheltering roof of a
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ramada</span></i> connecting two sections of the Gonzales <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa</span></i>,
lies David Morning, hot with fever, and still unable to
leave his couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little apart, and softly swaying in her hammock
of scarlet and gold, one foot lightly touching the
ground, half reclines the small, undulating figure of
Murella Gonzales.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancient blood of Castile had never been suffered
by the Gonzales family to mingle, with the sanction of
the church, with ignobler currents. The late Señor
Don Pedro, although only possessed of the estate of
a prosperous Mexican cattle rancher, was yet a
Hidalgo of Hidalgoes, who could have covered the
walls of his <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa</span></i> with his quarterings. As for his
wife, was she not an Alvarado? and—Santa Maria!—what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>more would you have in the way of blood?
Certainly, from her arched instep to her wealth of
blue-black hair, the Señorita Murella was a wondrously
beautiful maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Murella,” spoke the sick man, turning his emaciated
face toward the girl, “during the early days of
my illness, I gave you a letter to mail, do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you remember how many days ago, Murella?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Si, señor, seventeen day,” and the small ears
deepened red behind the creamy oval face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you give Jose the letter to post?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very kind, señorita, and I thank you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl glanced swiftly across the court at an open
door wherein stood the madroña, the customary
shawl of black Spanish lace drawn tightly across her
mouth, leaving two shining black eyes fixed steadily
upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A few days more, and I shall be leaving your
hospitable roof,” continued Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why will you not take a me with you?” said
Murella, with imperturbable gravity, and with no
change of expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man illy concealed his look of surprise, as he
tucked the richly embroidered pillow more firmly beneath
his head, and replied kindly:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such a thing could not possibly be, little girl, for
more reasons than your pretty head could contain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you do not a lof me, and you told a me a
lie,” and the dark eyes lit with a flame of Vesuvian
fires like the red light in those of a tiger.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“What do you mean, señorita?” and a faint flush
overspread his own pale face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean you call me your beloved Ella, such name
as Americans give a me, and you hold me close in your
arms, and say you will never part from me, not for
one hour—only ten day ago—and now you leave a
me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an awkward situation, and Mr. Morning
recognized its full significance upon the moment. In
his delirium he had used the too familiar name, and
had coupled with its use endearments which had been
compromisingly misappropriated. He reflected a
moment. There was nothing left but to tell the truth
and accept the consequences. Another girl would
laugh. What would Murella do?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Señorita,” he began slowly, “I have, as you
know, been very ill, and on several occasions have
lost my way in delirium, and have been wandering
over scenes belonging to other days. Can you not
forgive me if I have called you by a name which you
mistook for your own prettier one? Can you not
pardon me if in my fevered imagination I gave you
for the moment a place long ago sanctified and dedicated
to forgetfulness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why cannot you lof a me? Am I not as
lofely as she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very beautiful, Murella.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Machacha!” shrieked the duenna from the entrance
to the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ramada</span></i>, “what are you saying?” and
then followed invective in every key, and words of
scorn in every cadence, until, pale with anger and
chagrin, the girl sprang from her hammock and ran
swiftly away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>For a long time our hero lay lost in speculation.
After all, it was only a misunderstanding, and not liable
to be remembered overnight. In any event, he
had not compromised the maiden, and finally he concluded—as
was indeed the truth—that the cunning
señorita was all the while cognizant of the situation,
and not at all deceived, and so he dismissed the subject
from his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what was the first move of the panic-stricken
maiden? Speeding swiftly over the ground, she sank
in the shadow of the ocotilla hedge inclosure, which
formed the corral, and drew cautiously from her
pocket the letter committed to her care by Morning.
Reopening it, for the envelope, sealed only with mucilage,
had been carefully broken, she drew forth a
picture of the Baroness Von Eulaw, older by many
years than the name she now bore, and much thumbed
and worn beside.</p>

<p class='c007'>This unconscious incendiary Murella first regarded
disdainfully for an instant, and then deliberately spat
upon it. She then proceeded to possess herself of the
contents of the letter, which was brief, and, regarded
as a wholesome irritant for a recent wound, rather ineffectual.
She spelled it out laboriously, and it read
as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>To the Baroness Von Eulaw, Berlin.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>You may have forgotten that several years ago, and
through wholly legitimate means, let me say in self-defense,
a specimen of art, of inestimable value to me,
came into my possession. I have hitherto deemed it
no breach of honor to retain it. Finding myself very
ill, however, and warned by my physicians of the probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>fatal termination of my malady, I esteem it prudent
and not less just to return to you the last token
of a mutual recognition which I have the faith to believe
is among the things that are undying.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is, perhaps, unwillingness to pass the veil which
enshrouds the great mystery, without first vindicating
myself in your esteem, that impels me to tell you that
which I have heretofore thought to keep secret—that
your letter, written in February, 1883, was accidentally
mislaid in an old desk, and was never opened or perused
by me until the day after you became the Baroness
Von Eulaw.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Always yours sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>David Morning</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Murella spread the letter upon the ground and pondered.
Plainly it was not a love letter, as she had expected—almost
hoped! for she missed the ecstasy and
exhilaration of that desire for vengeance which is the
stimulus to passion in the breast of any true scion of
the Spanish race, and devoid of which life has little
zest.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might have been written to his grandmother for
all she could gather from its contents, and the thought
suggested the duenna, with her cruel eyes and hard,
wrinkled mouth, whose duty it was to watch her from
all points of the compass. So she folded the letter,
and, taking up the picture, again scrutinized it. “Devil!
devil! devil!” she broke out, as she smote the pasteboard
with her tiny soft fist. Then, folding it away
with the letter, she slipped them into her pocket, and,
gliding around the ocotilla palings, she entered her
apartment through an outer door, where she resealed
the missive, and, summoning the messenger Jose, bade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>him forthwith journey to Tucson, and deposit it in
the post office there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was sinking behind Tehachape Mountains,
and its parting rays, full of the color of leaf and bough,
fell brightly upon the prostrate form of the invalid,
and as Murella dropped softly to the ground before a
low window, which opened upon the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ramada</span></i>, she
parted her muslin curtains and gazed devouringly
upon the well-knit, shapely form, and the broad-browed,
tinted face, while the light faded, and soft
voices grew higher as the family supper hour approached,
and tinkling sounds from mandolin and
guitar filled the night with music. Then, taking a
last look, she arose, and, stamping her foot upon the
ground, impatiently she ejaculated:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, bah! He too good for anyting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She joined the family group at supper with a look
of high disdain on her beautiful face, but otherwise undismayed,
and ate her <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</span></i> and <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</span></i>, and
scrambled for the whitest <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tomales</span></i> among her younger
brothers, very much as if David Morning had overruled
his physicians, and departed for Tucson in an ambulance
the day after he was wounded, as he had once
determined to do, instead of having lain there for a
month, drawing first upon her pity, and then upon
her fancy, and stirring things in her imagination generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in the moon-lit night, the soft summer winds
still busy among the boughs, a sweet girlish voice,
melodiously attuned to the notes of the mandolin, ran
through the dreams of David Morning, carrying the
passionful refrain, “Oh, illustrissimo mia,” and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>awoke, and still the sweet refrain, “Oh, illustrissimo
mia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several days went by, summer days full of work and
growth and promise outside, and still Morning was
unable to leave the Gonzales ranch. His pulse, which
the doctors declared had never regained its normal
beat, was low and intermittent, and the hectic flush
never left his cheek. At length typhoid fever was
developed, and for weeks he lay at the verge of death,
and for as many weeks Murella Gonzales sat at his
head by day, and made her bed at the foot of his
couch by night. The señora, the madroña, even the
cocoanut brown <em>machacha</em> of all work, each brought
fruit and drink and delicacies to dissuade him from his
delirium and tempt him back to health, but Murella
sat always with her graceful head resting lightly against
his pillow, silent, languid, and lovely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the doctors remonstrated and begged her
to leave him, but she only said, “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mañana, mañana</span></i>,”
and to-morrow never came. But it proved to be only
a question of time, and before the gray linings of the
poplar had slid into umber, or the pomegranate had
gained its full meed of sweet juices, David Morning
was brought a picturesque basket of Indian workmanship,
quite filled with letters which had found him out,
calling him back with the imperative voices of business
demands, to take his place again with the rank and file
of affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the last day came, and Murella, abandoning her
customary hammock, sat all the morning upon a thick
rug spread upon the ground, exhibiting her irritable
feeling by nervously tossing the clinging folds of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>lace mantilla back over her shoulder, or tracing the
figures of the rug absently. Morning seemed lost in
reverie for a long time; finally he spoke, evidently a
little doubtful where to begin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not need to tell you, señorita,” said he,
“that I feel the greatest gratitude toward the inmates
of this household, and I ask you to tell me, not what
you would wish me to do for you, but what is the wish
most dear to you if I were not in the world?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if Señor Morning die, I shall die too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no! if some fairy should wave its wand, or
some Fortunatus should drop uncounted gold at your
feet, what would you do first?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The soft eyes of Señorita Gonzales flamed as never
eyes of Saxon maiden burned, and she quickly replied,
rising and drawing nearer:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would have a <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa grande</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where would you have a grand <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa</span></i>, here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no!” giving her hand a truly Delsarte sweep
of motion. “Long time ago my mother take a me to
Yuma, and there I hear much talk about Castle Dome;
it is twenty, thirty miles up the great river Colorado.
One time we sail up there in steam a boat, and such
a rancheria—beautiful! Great trees, and rocks, and
the Indians have been show how by the padres long
time ago, and they have beautiful trees of figs, and
oranges, and lemon, and great vines. And I have
tink about it always. When I am rich a I shall drive
the Indians away, and give money for make a them
not hungry, and make a <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa</span></i> all like a same in picture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We all have our castles in Spain. Why not you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Murella?” and he drew forth a pencil, and, spreading
paper upon the table, asked her to sit down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said he, “we will build this fine house
upon paper. What shall we do first?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall have a dance-house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning smiled grimly; the mining camps enjoy a
monopoly of literary phrasing, and the compound
word was familiar, so he only said, “All right, a
salon for dancing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Si, señor, saloon,” repeated Murella gravely,
“and a grande saloon for beautiful flowers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A conservatory, of course, though that will be superfluous,”
he added, “in a country itself a hotbed
for tropic bloom. Why not hanging gardens like
those of Babylon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, beautiful!” clasping her little fingers in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” looking into her face, pencil suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And a beautiful room for a you,” and she paused
for a moment, “with, with what you call, wall like
the sky before the sun a come, and morning glory
flower go all around the top,” pointing to the
frieze, “a like a your name, Señor Mia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning suddenly discovered something upon the
toe of his boot, and the girl struggled on in very bad
English, but with charming enthusiasm. She planned
and he interpreted. They first laid out the grounds,
availing themselves of the groves already planted by
the Indians. They covered acres of ground with
rare exotics, studding them with statuary in creamiest
marble, chiseled from designs of their own, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Psyche and Cupid to guard the main entrance to the
park.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that ting she a hold in her hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a torch,” explained Morning. “Psyche
is the soul, and Cupid is love, and she is going in
search of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did she find a him?” archly questioned the
girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think not,” said Morning, gloomily drawing
forth a fresh sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And about the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa grande</span></i>,” continued Morning,
“of what shall it be built?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The señorita rested her pretty chin between her
two palms and meditated. Finally she decided it
should be like the cupids, of shining marble, with agate
or onyx for columns, and garnets—found in quantities
in Arizona—for smaller decorations. This most
elaborate plan having been at length crudely completed,
Mr. Morning folded it, quietly saying he
would submit it to an architect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not truly?” said the girl, springing to her feet
with shining eyes and hands crossed upon her breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, really and truly, for your own sweet self, and
for your hospitable family; and with my kindest regards
and deepest gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Murella turned very pale. Dreams were not dreamed
to be so realized. Was he teasing her?</p>

<p class='c007'>Hitherto her self-love had made her the central
figure in her own mind. All things about her had
been dwarfed and become inconsequent in her egotistic
life, because she was wholly ignorant of any possibilities
outside of the power she wielded through her
beauty and her grace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>But a new element had been added to her limited
experience, and it had developed into a magician,
or had it done so really? The doubt took momentary
possession of her, and she arose in an attitude
of defiance, her flashing eyes resting upon the
amused but open countenance of David Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she knew that she looked into the face of her
god, and she fled to her room, and, sinking upon the
floor, she covered her face with her mantilla, and
sobbed convulsively.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='small'>“Secrecy is the soul of all great designs.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was October when Morning arrived in New York
City. Steel had been prompt in shipping the gold
not covered with copper, and Morning’s bank accounts
in New York now amounted to sixteen millions of dollars,
while the fame of the Morning mine as a producer
of four millions of gold bars per month had
already created a marked sensation in financial and
business circles, and in the newspaper world, but none
suspected the immense actual production.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning visited Washington, and bought a stone
warehouse near the foot of Sixth Street. He purchased
a similar building in Philadelphia, near the
Pennsylvania Railroad freight depot, and he bought a
third warehouse alongside the track of the New Jersey
Central at Hoboken. He caused switches to be constructed
into each of these warehouses, and provided
each of them with heavy iron shutters and doors.
He employed four watchmen for each building, divided
into day and night-watches of six hours each. He
arranged that the copper-pigs containing gold should
be loaded on the cars at Tucson by his own men,
who were themselves unaware that they were handling
anything but copper, and the cars locked and sent in
train-load lots through, without change or rehandling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, where
they were run into his warehouses and there unloaded.
It was given out that he was at the head of a copper
syndicate, and was storing the surplus product of the
mines for higher prices. His plans worked with perfect
smoothness, and his wealth accumulated openly
at the rate of four millions per month, and secretly at
the rate of one hundred millions per month, with a
vast amount of newspaper comment concerning the
four millions, and no suspicion anywhere as to the
real sum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advocates of free coinage of silver, who were
defeated in the Congress of 1889–90, renewed their
contest in the Congress of 1891–92, and in February,
1892, a free coinage law passed, but it was vetoed
by President Harrison. The silver men carried the
fight into the presidential election of 1892, and were so
far successful that Congress, in February, 1894, enacted
a law the text of which was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“From and after July 1, 1894, any person may deposit
at the treasury of the United States in Washington,
or at either of the sub treasuries in Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St Louis, New Orleans,
Denver, or San Francisco, gold or silver bars of standard
fineness, and receive the coined value thereof in
United States treasury notes. The secretary of the
treasury is authorized and directed to prepare and
keep on hand a sufficient amount of treasury notes to
comply with the provisions of this act.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The influence of Morning as the largest single producer
of gold in the world, as the owner already of
thirty millions of dollars, and, if his mine should hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>out for five years, of a sum that would cause him to
outrank any millionaire in the world, was very great,
and that influence, legitimately exercised in behalf of
free coinage, proved very potent with senators and
representatives, and did much to reconcile the adherents
of a single gold standard to the overthrow of
their system.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was argued that if the gold supply of the world
was to be increased forty per cent per annum by the
yield of the Morning mine, that would diminish relatively
the production of silver, and the ancient parity
of the metals might be restored “without danger to
our financial interests, Mr. Speaker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus reasoned the Honorable Senile Jumbo, who
represented a New England district in the House.
Jumbo was a banker at home, and because he was
a banker was supposed to know something about
finance, and was, in consequence, accorded a leading
position on the House Committee on Banking and
Currency.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact, Jumbo only knew a good discount from a
poor one. His definition of a banker would have been
that of the Indiana editor, who described such a functionary
as “a gentleman who takes the money of one
man without interest, and loans it to another upon interest,
and places both depositor and borrower under
obligations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By his small shrewdness Jumbo had gained a large
fortune, and secured a seat in Congress; but of the
laws which govern finance in its politico-economic relations
he had no more knowledge than has a locomotive
fireman about the law of dynamics, or a drygoods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>clerk about the culture of the silkworm. Yet
the Honorable Senile Jumbo looked wise, and talked
from the pit of his stomach, and respected the views
of other rich men, and as a congressman he averaged
with his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c007'>What strange distortion of brain is it that causes
men conspicuously unfit for public life, to seek elevations
which can only expose their intellectual poverty?
One who does not comprehend the French tongue or
know anything about science, would be laughed at for
seeking to be elected a member of the French Academy
of Sciences, yet senatorial togas and congressional
seats are constantly sought by gentlemen whose
previous pursuits have unfitted them to “shine in the
halls of high debate,” and who, indeed, would be puzzled
to put together, while on their feet, ten sentences
of grammatical English.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great and growing wealth of Morning caused
his society to be courted, and many a managing
mamma was not unmindful of the fact that the “Arizona
Gold King,” as he began to be called, was a
bachelor. This man did not “wear his heart upon
his sleeve,” and did not proclaim that his bachelorhood
was confirmed, or had any special reason for its
existence, but all plotting against him was in vain, for
the Ellen lost to him was the constant companion of
his thoughts, and to all movements and plans and purposes
of life he applied instinctively the test, “What
would she think of it?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was the anniversary of one of the great victories
achieved by Germany in the war of 1870, and Berlin
had scarcely known a day so filled with noise, and
glitter, and color, and esprit as this day had been.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Baroness Von Eulaw, the beautiful American,
was more sought for than ever, and the too arduous
round of social duties and engagements were beginning
to tell upon her delicate constitution. Cards
had been received by the baron and his wife for a reception
at the palace, and such an invitation could
scarcely be overlooked, especially as no entertainment
seemed acknowledged by her friends to be complete
without the presence of the baroness. Therefore, retiring
a little earlier this evening than was usual from
her own drawing rooms, the baroness was well advanced
with her toilette when she discovered letters
which the footman had left upon her table during her
absence, and among them one bearing the postmark of
Tucson, Arizona, and addressed in a well-known hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She felt too excited to trust herself farther, and, before
tearing the envelope, she sent her maid with a
message of her sudden indisposition, which she begged
the baron to deliver in person to the emperor, and
asked, furthermore, not to be disturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It was all one to the baron at this hour, and though
he speedily departed for the imperial palace, it is
doubtful whether the high officials in waiting deemed
it advisable to admit him to the imperial presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dismissing her servants, the baroness was left alone
for the night. Then she turned to her dressing-table
and stood while opening the letters, glancing hurriedly
at their contents, all but one, and this she turned over
many times. What was the burden of its mission,
and what did it contain? Finally her trembling fingers
picked absently at the envelope, as if she had
forgotton how to proceed. She might be unafraid,
for there was his own handwriting before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this thought a thrill went through her heart,
and with a sudden motion she tore the envelope quite
apart, and her own photograph fell to the floor. She
did not stoop for it, for her eyes were fixed upon the
page. Slowly she read word by word, lingering over
the last, and cutting it away from its context, as if
fearful that another word should overwhelm her reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>She finished, and an awful silence fell upon her.
She could hear her heart beat against her rich corsage,
and her breath crackled as it came through her dry
lips. What was the purport of that letter? She had
already forgotten. Something surely had left a heavy
pain at her heart. Just as slowly she read it through
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he was not dead—or, stay, he might be, for
did he not say “probably,” not “possibly”? Then,
still standing before the dressing-table, she leaned forward,
and, putting her face close to the mirror, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>muttered, looking into her own deep eyes the while,
“Great God! what did I do?” For a full moment
she stood thus, then, lifting the powder-puff from the
jeweled case, she mechanically swept her cheeks and
brow and sat down. Then she caught the letter and
read it again, this time more clearly and calmly, “the
probable fatal termination,” and again, “until the
day after you became the Baroness Von Eulaw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at her toilette. What was she doing
bejeweled and brocaded that night? Where were the
sackcloth and ashes she had earned? She arose and
pulled the diamonds from their places, and the beautiful
robe from her lovely shoulders, and put on a
gown of creamy plush, bordered with some dark, rich
fur, and, slowly tying the cords, her eyes fell upon the
picture at her feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took it between her fingers as if it were a dead
thing, and thought at the moment that it weighed a
pound at the least. And this was Ellen Thornton!
Then she thought how old-fashioned her dress looked,
and for a moment she felt glad that she had gotten
the picture back. Another revulsion of feeling as she
looked upon the torn envelope. What would she not
suffer for the hope, the uncertainty, she had clung to
when she tore that paper half an hour ago?</p>

<p class='c007'>If only the doctors could have said “possibly,” not
“probably;” perhaps that was what they meant, and
not “probably,” she repeated. Doctors are so clumsy—especially
some—and they do so exaggerate in
order to magnify the importance of their case, and
for a moment she took unction in such logic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a new thought took possession. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>baron—“where did he come in?” as he himself
would have expressed it, and she half smiled at the
grotesqueness of the thought. Was she not married?
and did she not owe him allegiance as a woman of
honor? If she had told him all that her soul held in
keeping for another, would he have made her the
Baroness Von Eulaw?—Very likely, but she was not
prepared to believe it. She had no right to hold him
responsible for offenses against her while she was
holding perfidy to her heart, and she marveled that
she had failed to make this argument a shield against
the shafts of her great sorrow and her almost greater
chagrin.</p>

<p class='c007'>She would destroy both the letter and the picture,
and put away all thought of the unhappy occurrence.
But, examining the picture again, she discovered two
little punctures just through the pupils of the shadowy
eyes, and she thought and queried for the cause of
such an accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally she concluded that her old lover had made
them inadvertently in fastening the picture to his wall
or mirror frame, and so, pressing her lips warmly to
the tiny wounds on the unconscious paper, where she
fancied his fingers had rested, she locked both the
photo and letter in her desk, and, just as daylight
broke, long after the clanging of the locks had ceased
and the brightness was withdrawn, she braided her
hair as she had worn it so many years ago when the
image was made, and, with a long look in the mirror
to find a trace of her old self, she turned away to her
couch, and disposed herself for an hour of sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the last among her sea of speculations was this:
“I wonder who made those pin-holes in my eyes!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The Hod-Carriers’ Union and Mortar-Mixers’ Protective
Association, of San Francisco, adopted a resolution
in February, 1894, to fix the rate of wages of
its members at $3.00 per day, and admitting no new
members for a period of one year. The immediate
cause of this resolution was the letting, by certain capitalists,
of contracts for the construction of several
blocks of buildings on Market Street, including the
new post-office building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phelim Rafferty, in proposing the resolution, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The owners and the contractors, Mr. Prisident
and gentlemen, are min of large means, sor, yit they
propose to pay us, the sons of honest toil, sor, widout
whose brawny muscles they could not build at all, sor,
they propose to pay us a beggarly $2.00 a day, sor.
Why, the min in the public schools who taich the pianny
to our gurls, sor, recaive more nor that! Now,
sor, if we pass this risolution we put our wages to
$3.00 a day, and hould them there. We have the
mortal cinch on the contractors, sor, for if any mimber
of our union works for less than $3.00 we’ll expel
him; and by passin’ this risolution we’ll keep min
from the East away, and keep the mimbership in San
Francisco shmall, and we’ll be sure of a job.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Faith! the bosses will have to be mighty civil to us
to git us at all, sor. And if they thry to put to work
min who are not mimbers of the union, their buildings
will niver rise out of their cellars, sor, for the other
thrades are compilled to sthand by us, sor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lorin French, the millionaire contractor and
owner of the great San Francisco Iron Works, read
in the journal next morning an account of the action
taken by the Hod-Carriers Union and Mortar-Mixers’
Protective Association, and he smiled a grim smile.
That day he sent invitations to a number of capitalists
and contractors to attend a meeting at his offices, and
the result of the conference was the formation of a
Manufacturers’ and Builders’ League, of which Mr.
Lorin French was chosen permanent president.</p>

<p class='c007'>The daily papers the next morning contained the
following advertisement:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>WANTED.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On the first day of next month, two hundred hod-carriers
and mortar-mixers to work on the new post-office block.
Three dollars per day will be paid until further notice.
Men who have applied for and been refused admittance to
membership in the Hod-Carriers’ Union will be preferred.</p>

<p class='c007'>This base attempt of capital to coerce or bribe the
worker into allowing another worker an equal chance
of obtaining employment, was denounced by Rafferty
the next night in a ringing speech at a special meeting
of the Hod-Carriers’ Union, which meeting resulted
in a convention of the Federated Trades being
ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>At this convention it was resolved by a three-fourths
majority, after a hot debate, that no member of any
trade organization would, on penalty of expulsion, be
permitted to work in or upon or in aid of the construction
of any building, or in any shop, mill, foundry, or
factory, or in or upon any work where any person
not a member of some trade-organization was employed,
or where any material was used which had
been manufactured by non-union labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My frent from the Plumbers’ Association speaks
of this resolution, Mr. President, as a poomerang,”
said Gustave Blather, a labor lecturer, who on this
occasion represented the Dishwashers’ Lagerbund.
“I don’t know as such languitch is quite broper
coming from him, for a goot many beople haf their
doubts whether plumbing is really a trate or only a
larceny. But, my fellow pret-winners, if the resolution
is a poomerang, it is one that will knock the arrogance
out of the ploated wealth-owners, and teach
them that in this republic—established by the ploot of
our fathers [Blather’s great-grandfather was a Hessian
soldier in the British army, and returned to Darmstadt
after the surrender of Cornwallis]—in this republic
the time is close at hand when suppliant wealth will
be compelt to enture the colt and hunger it has gifen
to labor for many years.” And, amid a storm of applause,
Blather sank to his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The post office block was begun on the day appointed,
with a force of men, all of whom were members
of the trade organizations, and the work progressed
steadily for a week. At the Saturday-night
meetings of the several trade organizations, the members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>congratulated themselves that “old French” had
concluded not to carry out his programme, and in
several lodges it was proposed to signalize the magnificent
victory of labor over capital by demanding a
general advance of twenty per cent in the wages of
all mechanics; but some of the wiser heads discouraged
the movement as premature, and one pessimistic
house carpenter observed, amid expressions of dissent
from his colleagues, that if all the mechanics followed
the example of the hod carriers, it would “bust wide
open every builder and contractor in Frisco, or else
put a stop to all building.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the next Monday morning there appeared on
the scene ten men clad in blouses and overalls. Three
of them worked at mixing mortar, three of them carried
hods, three of them commenced laying brick,
while the tenth man directed the labors of the other
nine. Each had buckled about his waist in plain
sight a cartridge belt from which hung a dragoon revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as their presence and labors became known,
word was sent to labor headquarters, and Delegate
Brown was deputed to interview the strangers and
ascertain the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pap Brown was a journeyman stone cutter on the
other side of the sixties, who did not often work at
his trade. The salary he received from the trade
unions was sufficient for his support, and he fully
earned his salary. He was shrewd, suave, and persistent,
and his fatherly way with “the boys,” and
deferential manner to employers, often secured to
the former favorable adjustments of contests that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>would have been denied to the “silver-tongued”
Raffertys and Blathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pap Brown approached one of the men who was
engaged in mixing mortar, and inquired whom he was
working for. The man addressed made no reply,
but signaled the foreman, who came forward and
curtly answered:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are all working for Mr. Lorin French.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What wages do you get?” asked Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” replied the foreman after a pause, “strictly
speaking, I don’t know as that concerns you, but I
have no objection to telling you. The mortar-mixers
and hod-carriers get $3.00 a day, the bricklayers
$4.00, and I get $5.00.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Them’s union wages,” said Brown, approvingly.
“You are strangers in Frisco, I jedge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We arrived last Friday night from Milwaukee,”
replied the foreman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you got your cards as members of the union?” said Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied the party addressed, “we belong to
no union.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum! I suppose you are calkilatin’ to jine the unions
here?” inquired Brown in a persuasive accent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am told,” replied the foreman, “that so far as
the Hod-Carriers’ Union is concerned, we cannot join if
we wish to; that they have resolved to admit no new
members.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pap Brown slowly revolved his tobacco quid in
his mouth, and rapidly revolved the situation in his
wise old brain. “Hum!” said he at length, “I reckon
that can be arranged for ye, so that ye can all jine.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Well,” replied the man from Milwaukee, “I may
as well tell ye that we don’t calculate to jine anyhow.
We don’t much believe in unions nohow—too many
fellers a settin’ around drinkin’ beer, which the fellers
that work have to pay for.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mebbe you don’t know,” said Pap Brown, “that
only union men will be allowed to work here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who will stop us?” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are a good many thousand of the brotherhood
in this city,” said Delegate Brown, still persuasively,
“and there are only ten of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we ten are fixed to stay,” said the foreman,
glancing significantly at his cartridge belt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum!” remarked Pap Brown, as he walked
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night there was a conference at the labor
headquarters of the Executive Committee of the Federated
Trades, and Delegate Brown was called upon
to report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I find,” said he, “that these ten men have all
worked at their trades somewhere, and our watchers
say that they are good workmen; but clearly they
have been hired more as fighters than as hod carriers
or masons. I jedge, from what I hear, that there is
an organized force behind them. They sleep and
take their meals in old French’s building on Market
Street, and don’t go out to the saloons, and we can’t
very well get at them. Old French is as cunning as
Satan, and he has fixed the job upon us, and put these
men to work to bring things to a point. There is a big
force of Pinkerton’s men in the city all ready to be sworn
in as deputy sheriffs in case of a row, and I reckon it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>is put up to call in the soldiers at the Presidio and from
Alcatraz in case of trouble, for the post-office building,
where the men are working, is government property.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What action do you suggest we should take, Mr.
Brown?” said the chairman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pap Brown rolled his quid from one cheek to the
other, and then solemnly deposited it in the cuspidor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t do,” he replied, “to monkey with Uncle
Sam; my jedgment is to jist let them ten men alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” interposed a member of the committee,
“old French will never stop there. Those ten men
are merely the small end of a wedge with which he intends
to split our labor unions to pieces. He will not
give us the sympathy of the people by lowering wages,
but he will put on scabs, a dozen at a time, and discharge
our members, until the city is filled with new
workmen, the unions broken up, and we can all emigrate
to Massachusetts or China.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” said Pap Brown, “but violence
to them ten men would simply be playin’ into
old French’s hand. He has figgered for a fight, but
we mustn’t give it to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will carry out,” said the Chairman, “in a
peaceful way, the resolution adopted by the Congress
of Federated Trades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” said Pap Brown, “means a gineral strike
and an all-around tie-up, that’s what it means, jest at
the beginnin’ of the buildin’ season, with our union
treasuries mostly empty, and our brethren East in no
fix to help us, for the coke strikes and the shettin’
down of the cotton factories and iron foundries this
winter have dreened them all. I was agin that resolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of the Federated Trades at the time, and I’m
mighty doubtful about it’s workin’ any good to us
now. It was well enough for a bluff, but if we are
called down we haven’t got a thing in our hands, that’s
a fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what can we do, Mr. Brown?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe that the best thing all around would be
to give in to old French now, repeal that fool resolution,
and wait for a better time to strike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! surrender without a blow? That, Mr.
Brown, we can never do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then,” rejoined Pap Brown, “I reckon
we’ve got a long siege ahead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Executive Committee appointed a delegation
to wait on Mr. Lorin French and inform him that unless
the employment of the ten non-union men was
discontinued, the resolution of the Federated Trades
would be enforced, and all Trade Union members working
for him, or for any member of the Manufacturers’
and Builders’ Union, would quit work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. French received the committee very curtly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those ten men,” said he, “will continue their labors
though they shall be the only ten men at work in
the city of San Francisco. If one, or one thousand, or
ten thousand of you are fools enough to quit work at
the high wages you have yourselves fixed, simply because
I have given work at the same wages to men
who don’t choose to join one of your bullying unions,
why, you can quit. You can’t hurt me by quitting as
much as you will hurt yourselves. My money will
keep and your work won’t. But take notice that
every man who does quit work will be blacklisted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and he can never get another job in this city from me,
or any of the gentlemen who are members of the association
of which I am president, and we include
about all the large employers of labor in this city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, Mr. French,” said the Chairman of
the committee, “that if you insist on keeping these ten
non-union men at work we can order a general strike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know it,” replied French. “I know that
you can bite off your own noses to spite your own
faces. I feel sorry for you workingmen at times, you
are such unreasoning and unreasonable and everlasting
fools. When you order a strike, you order the
absolute destruction of the only property you have—your
labor—and you do this in order to prevent a few
men from selling their labor; a few men whose only
offense is that they don’t believe with you in the wisdom
of harassing and plundering capitalists.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I suppose we have a right to strike, haven’t
we?” said the Chairman angrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said French, “you have not. The worker
who joins a strike faces at least the possibility of capital
closing its works and retiring from the field, and
the men who have been extravagant, idle, unthrifty,
or unfortunate, and most of you have been one or the
other, have no moral right to bring upon themselves
or those dependent upon them, either suffering or
mendicancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. French,” said the Chairman, “you know a
good many things, but you don’t know the power of
the labor organizations of the land. If we willed it,
we could in one day stop production and transportation
all over the United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“You would do well to think three or four times,”
replied French, “before exercising any such power as
that. You workingmen are overstepping the bounds
not only of moderation, but of common justice and
common sense. Suppose you should do what you
threaten, what do you suppose the capitalists would
do in turn? You don’t know? Well, I can tell you.
We would say that we were weary of your exactions,
your interference, and your airs. We would say to
you: ‘You have stopped the wheels; very well, we
will not start them. You have extinguished the furnace
fires, we will not rekindle them. You have disabled
the engines, we will not repair them. With the
downward stab of your vicious knife you have cut our
surface veins, but you have received the force of the
blow in your own vitals—bleed to death at your leisure.
We will retire for a while and nurse our scratches.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t know what you are talking about,”
continued the old man. “You don’t conceive the
misery and ruin that would result from sixty days’
stoppage of labor in the fields and foundries and factories
and furnaces, and sixty days’ suspension of traffic
over the railroads of our land. With the disabled
engines in the roundhouses, and the cars covered with
dust in the deserted yards; with ships and steamers
lying idle at the wharves or sailed away to trade between
the ports of other lands, whose governments, wiser or
more powerful than ours, would not suffer the moral
law to be violated by either individuals or societies;
with moss gathered upon the turbines; with chimneys
towering smokeless to the skies; with the music of
forge and anvil hushed; with almshouses crowded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>asylums filled, and jails overflowing; with men suffering
and women growing gaunt from hunger, and
little children sobbing themselves to the fevered sleep
of famine; with the furniture in the auction room,
trinkets and clothing in the pawn shop, and families
once comfortable wandering shelterless under the
stars; with even disease welcomed as a friend who should
pilot the sufferer to the deliverance of death, would
you find consolation for it all in the reflection that you
had, maybe, carried your point and prevented non-union
men, who are as good as yourselves in every
way, from working alongside you at the same wages
you demanded for yourselves?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. French,” said the Chairman, “what do you
wish us to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care what you do,” was the response,
“but if you have any sense, you will go home and repeal
your fool resolution to strike if non-union workers
are employed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That, Mr. French,” said the spokesman, “we cannot
and will not do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?” replied the millionaire. “Well, you must
go to destruction then in your own way. Goodmorning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At noon the next day the hod-carriers dropped
their hods, not only at the post-office block, but at all
buildings in process of construction by any capitalist
or contractor belonging to the Builders’ and Manufacturers’
Union. The brick-masons stopped work because
they would not lay brick with mortar mixed or
carried by a non-union laborer. The house carpenters
declined to drive a nail in aid of the erection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>any building in which a brick should be laid by one
not belonging to the Bricklayers’ Union. No plumber
or gasfitter would carry his tools to a building whose
timbers had been put in place by a scab carpenter.
The teamsters would not haul sand, brick, lime, or
lumber for use in any building to be erected by any
member of the association of which Lorin French was
president. The iron-moulders abandoned in a body
the great shops, rather than work on columns or fronts
which had been ordered for the tabooed buildings.
Engineers and firemen struck, rather than attend to
the running of machinery in factories where non-union
men were employed, and all workers engaged in any
factory, foundry, mill, shop, or business owned, in
whole or in part, by any member of the Builders’ and
Manufacturers’ Union, joined the general strike, while
the railroads were compelled, in self-protection, to refuse
freight offered by any member of the organization
of which Lorin French was president.</p>

<p class='c007'>No attempt was made by French or his colleagues
to supply the places of the strikers with non-union
workers, although every mail from the East brought
hundreds of applications for employment, but each
factory, foundry, and shop was closed, one after the
other, as the workers joined the strike. The ten men
whose labors on the post-office building had begotten
all this commotion, continued steadily at work. They
were surrounded each day, while at their labors, by
hooting thousands, who gathered in the vicinity, but
any near approach to them was prevented by a company
of Pinkerton’s men, armed with Winchesters,
who had been sworn in as deputy sheriffs, and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>escorted them to and from their labors, to French’s
building, No. 1099 Market Street, where they, as well
as their guards, were accorded quarters, and in the
upper story of which Mr. Lorin French had, under
existing circumstances, deemed it expedient to establish
his residence as well as his offices.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a fortnight had elapsed these ten men were
withdrawn from their labors, in deference to the request
of the Mayor of San Francisco and the governor
of California.</p>

<p class='c007'>A committee from the Federated Trades then waited
upon Lorin French, and informed him that, as the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">causa belli</span></i> had been removed by the withdrawal of the
ten obnoxious non-union laborers, the strikers were
willing to resume work. His reply was that whenever
work should be resumed generally, the ten “obnoxious”
men, as well as all other non-union men he
might see fit to employ, would resume work; and
so negotiations came suddenly to an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the third week of the strike the Congress
of Federated Trades assembled and declared a
boycott against all members of the Builders’ and
Manufacturers’ Union, and against all who should violate
the boycott; the boycott to run also against any
railway or steamship line that should accord them or
their families transportation out of San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was expected that this last and most drastic measure
would bring the capitalists to terms, for its enforcement
would deprive them and their families of the
necessities of life. Their employes left them under
the pressure, and their offices and places of business
were closed. Their house servants departed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>they were unable to obtain substitutes even among
the Chinese, for the Celestial who should labor for a
boycotted household was given his choice between
exile and death. Hotel proprietors were compelled
to refuse a boycotted person as a guest, or lose their
own waiters, cooks, and chambermaids. The restaurant
proprietor who should serve one of them with
a meal would be compelled to close his doors for the
want of help; and the grocer, fruiterer, butcher, baker,
or provision dealer who sold supplies for their use,
would be posted, and lose his other customers, for the
boycott was declared against all who violated the
boycott.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. French was equal to the exigency. He caused
representations to be made, and influence exerted at
Washington, and the United States steamer <em>Charleston</em>
was detailed for special service. The members of
the Builders’ and Manufacturers’ Association, with
their families, were taken on board of the war-ship,
guarded by the Pinkerton men, and carried to Vancouver,
where they were dispatched East over the Canadian
Pacific Railroad. Lorin French, with a few of
his fellow-members, refused to go, but, establishing
themselves comfortably on the upper floor of the
building No. 1099 Market Street, they managed to
provision themselves and their guards, despite the
boycott, and announced their determination to see
the contest out.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the last week in April, 1894, and the tenth
week of the great strike. Business was almost suspended
in San Francisco. Thousands of the strikers
had wandered out into the country, and every farmhouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>within a hundred miles of San Francisco was
besieged by men glad to work for food and shelter,
while the highways were crowded with tramps. In the
city the streets were filled with idle thousands, and at
the daily meeting at the sand lots twenty or thirty
thousand auditors were addressed by favorite speakers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The orators made no appeals which were calculated
to incite violence, and there was no police interference
with the meetings. Indeed, there seemed logically no
place or opportunity for violence. The offending
employers had done absolutely nothing that the
workers could even denounce. They had discharged
nobody, and they had not attempted to fill the places
of those who reluctantly left. They had simply suspended
operations. They had accepted the refusal of
the workers to work, apparently, as final. They had
locked up their factories and places of business, and,
with their families, had left the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strikers generally regarded Lorin French as the
prime mover against them, but his property they could
not reach for the purposes of destruction if they had
been so inclined. It consisted of mines in Nevada and
Utah and Montana, of sheep and cattle in New Mexico
and Arizona, of vineyards and orchards and grain-fields
in California, of mortgages and bonds, and of
unimproved real estate in San Francisco. On this
latter he was now preparing to erect business blocks.
But the buildings were in embryo. The mob could
neither burn nor dynamite an unbuilded structure,
and there was no visible property upon which to
wreak vengeance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet the most ample provisions had been made against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>any mob uprising. Two batteries of artillery, with
guns shotted with grape and canister, two companies
of cavalry, and four companies of infantry of the California
National Guard, were in readiness, a portion being
under arms, and signals were arranged for calling
the entire force together at the armories, ready for
action, on less than half an hour’s notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday night, late in April, 1894, the Congress
of Federated Trades again met, and, after a
short debate, it was sullenly resolved to accept the
situation. The strike was declared at an end, and all
the resolutions adopted since the preceding February,
including the original resolution of indorsement of
the action of the Hod-Carriers’ Union, were rescinded,
and it was enacted that hereafter the employment of
non-union workers should not be a cause of strike
except by workers associated in the same work, and
against the same employer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A committee of three, to consist of the President of
the Congress of Federated Trades, the Mayor of San
Francisco, and the Chief of Police, was appointed to
wait, early next morning, upon Mr. Lorin French,
communicate to him the action taken by the Federated
Trades, and receive his reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was surrender on the part of the workers—absolute
and unconditional. It was a blow to their pride,
and a relinquishment of that which, with many of them,
was a cherished principle; it was brought about by
hunger and suffering, and they gave up the contest
utterly, and placed themselves at the mercy of the
conqueror. Only a brute could have misused the
vanquished, but Lorin French had worked himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>into a relentless fury during the progress of the strike,
and, unfortunately, he had been left in full charge and
invested with plenary power by the departed members
of the Builders’ and Manufacturers’ Association.</p>

<p class='c007'>At nine o’clock the next morning, in the sunshine
of an April Sabbath, the committee appointed by the
Federated Trades was permitted to pass the Pinkerton
guard, and mount the five flights of stairs—for the
elevator service had long been discontinued—which
led to the top story of the building No. 1099
Market Street, where they were received by Lorin
French, who arose from his breakfast table to greet
them. He listened without changing his countenance
while the Mayor, as Chairman of the committee, communicated
to him the substance of the resolution
adopted the night before by the Congress of Federated
Trades.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I expected exactly such a result,” said French;
“it would have saved a great deal of money and a
great deal of suffering to these Federated fools if they
had adopted a similar course two months ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Mr. French,” said the Mayor, “these misguided
men, with their families, have been the greatest
losers and the severest sufferers by it all. I will not
discuss the rights and wrongs of it with you. There
is more than one side to it, and we might not agree.
I am rejoiced, for their sake and yours, and for the
sake of the city and State, that it is all over, and that
the workers can now return to their work, and business
resume its usual channels.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“These misguided men, as you call them, Mr.
Mayor,” said French, “will be compelled to transfer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>their opportunities for future misguidance to some
other locality. They are all blacklisted here. Their
own signatures to receipts for wages when they quit,
constitute the blacklist. Not one of them shall ever
earn another day’s wages in this city in any enterprise
owned, controlled, or influenced by me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Mr. French,” remonstrated the Mayor, “this
is unworthy of you. These men have homes here;
they have families to support; the long strike has
left many of them utterly without resources, either to
go away with or to establish themselves elsewhere.
The industries of San Francisco need them. Why
bring in others to take their places? They have abandoned
their strike. They have already been sufficiently
punished for that which was, after all, only an
error of judgment. If work be refused them, they will
starve.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let them starve,” savagely replied the millionaire;
“not one of them shall ever get a job of work from
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The President of the Congress of Federated Trades,
who was one of the committee, had hitherto been
silent. He was an iron worker by trade, who, in
twenty years of residence in San Francisco, had almost
lost the Scotch burr which, as a lad, he had brought
with him from Glasgow. In moments of feeling or
excitement it returned to him. He addressed himself
to French:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh mon,” said he, “but thou art hard; and thou
art a fool as well! ’Tis a mad wolf that cooms oot of
the mountain shingle to make a trail through the
heather for the hoonds. Gin ye hae no mercy for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>God’s poor, hae ye no fear frae the divil’s dogs that
your words may loosen on ye? Dinna ye ken there
be ten, aye, twenty thousand men on the sand lots this
blessed Sabbath morn, who love ye not, and who, if
they get your words just spoken, and get them they
maun, unless ye recall them, would, if they but reach
ye, and reach ye they will, for a’ your guards and
guns, would send ye to God’s throne wi’ your bad
heart a’ reekin’?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go and tell the loafers and brawlers of the sand
lots exactly what I have said,” shrieked French. “It
is what I mean to say, and mean for them to hear.
If you don’t take the message I will send it through
the press. Let them do their worst. I do not fear
the blackguards, and I am ready for any who choose
to visit me,” and the old man snapped his fingers as
the members of the committee sorrowfully departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later a speaker who was addressing
an audience of thirty thousand people from the central
stand at the sand lots, paused as he saw the
President of the Congress of Federated Trades making
his way through the crowd. The orator had been
commenting on the resolutions adopted by the
Workers’ Congress the previous night, and had been
congratulating the people upon the approaching end
of the distress occasioned by the long strike, and on
the days of peace and plenty which were in store for
them, and it was with beaming faces and glad shouts
that the multitude welcomed the man who was to announce
to them a resumption of their labors in factory
and shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends,” said the tall Scotchman, “I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>just come from an interview with Lorin French, and I
am vara vara sorry to bear you the message with which
I am charged. He bids me tell you that the notice he
gave to us all before the strike begun shall be carried
out, and that no man who quit work then shall ever
again have work in this city, if he can help it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The temper of the vast multitude changed in an
instant. Shrieks and yells of anger filled the air, and
for many minutes the crowd gave way to demonstrations
of rage and indignation. All at once there walked
to the front of the central platform a tall, angular
woman dressed in a gown of plain black stuff. Her
features were unprepossessing, to the verge of ugliness,
but a wealth of white hair crowned a low brow, surmounting
eyes of fierce blue. As she stretched forth
a long arm, the multitude hushed to silence, for they
recognized the renowned female agitator, Lucy
Passmore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friends, brethren, men,” said she, in a voice
whose magnetic quality vibrated to the farthest edges
of the crowd, “it seems that it is the malignant will
of one man which savagely condemns thousands to
suffering and starvation. If the rattlesnake is coiled
for ye, will ye strike first or wait for him to strike?
If the wolf is waiting upon your doorstep, will you feed
to him the babe he is seeking or will ye give him the
knife to the hilt in his hot throat? The death of Lorin
French would end this struggle, and your wives would
cease to weep and your children to cry with hunger.
Men, since God has so far forgotten you as to suffer
this devil to live so long, why do you not remedy
God’s forgetfulness? Are you ready to march now
or do you want an old woman to lead you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>A yell arose from the surging crowd, as, with one
mind, thousands comprehended and were ready to
act upon the suggestions of Lucy Passmore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the men had long before furnished themselves
with arms of some sort, and their lodge organizations
had provided them with elected leaders, who
usually attended the sand-lot meetings. As if by
magic they formed themselves into companies and
battalions and marched, an orderly and almost an organized
army, forth from the sand lots, and down to the
building No. 1099 Market Street, which they speedily
surrounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The iron shutters of the upper story were at once
closed, and the muzzles of rifles pushed through loopholes
previously prepared for such purpose. An
attempt was made from the inside to close the iron gate
in front of the main staircase, but the mob surged past
the guard, took possession of the lower hall, and
started up the stairs. They were met at the top, just
below the first landing, by twenty Pinkerton men
standing upon the top five steps—four on each step—who,
after vainly warning the ascending crowd to desist,
at last lowered the muzzles of their Winchesters,
and opened a murderous fusillade, which covered the
stairs with dead and dying.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mob hesitated for an instant, but only for an
instant, for those below pushed forward those who
were above. A hundred revolvers were fired at the
Pinkerton men, half of whom fell, and the other half
were borne down, shot, clubbed, and stabbed as the
mob rushed past and over them, and gained the first
landing. The crowd continued to push from below,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and in the same way, with great loss of life on each
side, they gained successively the third and fourth
stories. By this time, however, the forces on the fifth
floor had opened fire on the mob outside. Two riflemen
at each of the eighteen windows commanded the
main entrance to the building, and such a rapid and
accurate fire was maintained that Market Street for a
hundred feet on each side of the entrance was piled
with bodies, and further re-inforcements prevented
from reaching those within the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture Battery X came galloping into
Market Street from Fourth. Two guns were placed in
position, and one, loaded with grapeshot, was fired
just above the heads of the crowd. The whistling of
the shot in the air above them gave notice to the mob
of what was coming, and, with cries of terror, they fled,
panic-stricken, into the adjacent streets. The assailants
inside the building, hearing the noise of the cannon,
followed by the triumphant shouts of the Pinkerton
men in the upper story, and finding no further
pressure or re-inforcements from below, desisted from
further assault, and, turning from the fourth landing,
fled down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lorin French, from a loophole in an iron shutter,
watched the firing, and the dispersion of the mob outside,
and in a few minutes he was informed by a Pinkerton
sergeant that the contest was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a sorry day’s work, sir,” said the officer; “we
have lost over thirty of our best men, and there must
be two hundred rioters dead and wounded on the
stairs and in the halls, beside those killed in the street.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will help you with the wounded,” said French,
starting for the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Better remain here, sir,” said the officer. “It
may not be quite safe for you yet in the lower halls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense,” replied French, “the fight is over,”
and so saying, he walked out into the hall, and descended
the stairs to the fourth story. He paused in
horror at the sight which met his eyes. The floor was
wet and slippery with blood, and the cries of the
wounded pierced his ears. He stood for a moment as
if dazed, and then, turning his back upon the scene,
prepared to ascend the staircase and gain his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as he turned, a man who was sitting propped
up against the wall twenty feet away, raised a revolver
which had been lying in his lap, and, clearing with his
left hand the blood which obscured his eyes, took
rapid yet careful aim and fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bullet struck Lorin French in his backbone,
which it shattered, and, with a cry of agony and fear,
the owner of $20,000,000 fell forward upon his face on
the stairway.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='small'>“Is this law? Aye, marry is it?”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“In the matter of the estate of Lorin French deceased,
the application of Louis Browning for letters
executory is before the court. Who represents the
applicant?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The firm of Bruff &amp; Baldwin, your honor,” replied
a tall gentleman with spectacled nose and a
beardless face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are there contestants?” said the Court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then from their seats within the bar of the court
room there arose a decorous multitude of lawyers,
short and tall, old and young, fat and lean, the white-bearded
Nestors, and the complacent, chirping chipmunks
of the bar, and in various forms of expression
it clearly appeared that there were contestants.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” said his Honor with a weary smile,
“that my associates might have sent this case to
another department, for I have had a surfeit of contested
will cases. Proceed, Mr. Bruff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In behalf of the Society of Bug Hunters, who are
legatees under a former will,” said a sepulchral voice,
proceeding from the rotund diaphragm of a bald-headed
and full-bearded gentleman, “I have twenty-three
objections to offer to the admission to probate
of the alleged will of Lorin French, and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will my learned brother Lester permit me to interrupt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>him for a moment,” twanged a catarrhal tone,
“while I state that I wish my appearance entered
here on behalf of the recognized natural son of the
deceased, and I protest—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the part of the Australian cousins of Lorin
French,” shrieked a lean man with red hair, “I have a
preliminary objection to offer to the will being read in
court at all, and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I object!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I except!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will your honor please note the exception of the
Nevada heirs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I demand to be heard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then from the entire front of the bar came cries of
excited counsel, learned in all law save that of decorum,
while the Court rapped for order.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” said he, “you will all please be
seated. The Court itself would like to be heard.
The will of our deceased fellow-citizen, Lorin French,
who was never more regretted by me than at this
moment, or”—and the Court smiled deprecatingly—“the
paper which purports to be his will, is presented
here by our Brother Bruff. Now, unless some gentleman
denies the death of Lorin French, it occurs to
me that the reading of the paper offered as his will
can but tend to our common enlightenment—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep-voiced Lester, with his twenty-three objections,
sustained by a “brief” which covered ninety
pages of manuscript, arose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not yet finished,” said the Court. “It is
apparent that many of the objections urged will be
against the reading of the will. Such objections may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>be discussed more intelligently if the Court can be
suffered to gain some knowledge of the contents of
the paper offered, and I shall ask, gentlemen, that you
suspend argument or motions while the clerk reads
the will. It will then delight the Court to devote the
remainder of the term to hearing arguments why the
will ought never to have been read. Mr. Clerk, proceed,
and I will send to jail for contempt any member
of this bar who shall interrupt you until the reading
shall be completed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence in the crowded court room as the
clerk opened and read the document:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In the name of God, Amen, I, Lorin French, of
San Francisco, California, being of sound and disposing
mind and memory, but being assured by my
physicians that the wound received by me must within
a few days prove fatal, do make, publish, and declare
this my last will and testament, revoking all wills previously
made by me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The free use of my hand enables me to make
this will holographic, and this labor I undertake in
order to more completely demonstrate to the court
where it may be offered for probate, that it is altogether
my own act, and that I am sane, clear of mind,
and fully possessed of my own memory and judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The near approach of the world into which my
spirit is about to journey, brings, possibly, a clearer
judgment, and I think now that if my decision to employ
no strikers had not been communicated to the
mob, I should have reconsidered such decision.
However, my approaching death, which will incidentally
result from that decision, afflicts me less than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>fate of those who fell in the affray, for my own life
was drawing to a close.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the example I shall offer in attempting to adjust
the relations of capital and labor shall be followed by
others, it will result in advantage to the workers of
this land, and great permanent good may thus grow
from the bitter struggle which ended with the wound
which will terminate my life on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am unmarried and childless, and my nearest
living relatives are cousins of remote degrees, with
whose names and places of residence I am scarcely
acquainted. No relation of mine has any moral or
rightful claim upon my estate, and the disposition I
am about to make of my property will work injustice
to no living creature.</p>

<p class='c007'>I appoint as executor of this my last will and testament,
my friend Louis Browning, to serve without
bonds, and I direct that for his services as executor,
and in lieu of all commissions, he receive the sum of
$50,000 out of my estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>I direct my said executor to forthwith pay to the
widows, or next of kin, of each man slain in the late
riot, the sum of $10,000, to each man permanently
disabled by wounds received therein, the sum of $5,000,
and to each man wounded but not permanently
disabled, the sum of $1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>I direct my said executor to proceed as speedily as
possible to prudently dispose of all my estate, and
convert the same into money, to be paid over by him
to the corporation hereinafter named.</p>

<p class='c007'>I request that my said executor, Louis Browning,
shall, in co-operation with the Governor of California,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the Mayor of San Francisco, and my friends David
Shelburn, Lawrence Slayter, George Morrow, and
Francis Dalton, proceed forthwith to form a corporation
under the laws of this State, to be entitled the
‘Lorin French Labor Aid Company,’ to which corporation,
when organized, I direct that the proceeds
of my estate be transferred, to be used by it in providing
capital for the use of such co-operative and profit-sharing
corporations as may, from time to time, be organized
to avail themselves of its aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lorin French Labor Aid Company will not
itself engage in any industrial enterprise, but will confine
itself strictly to loaning money at three per cent
per annum to such organizations of mechanics as may
seek its assistance and comply with its rules. Those
rules must require that one-fourth of the wages and
all the profits of the members of the borrowing corporation
shall be paid to the Lorin French Labor Aid
Company, until the debt due the latter is discharged,
and that the borrowing corporation shall be organized
and conducted in accordance with certain conditions
and rules.</p>

<p class='c007'>My meaning may be made more clear by the following
illustration:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose that five hundred men shall desire to establish
a co-operative foundry. They will make a
preliminary organization and apply to the officers of
the Lorin French Labor Aid Company for the capital
necessary to conduct the enterprise. Those officers
will—after careful inquiry—ascertain that the buildings,
land, machinery, and plant of such a foundry will
cost $900,000, and that it will require a cash capital of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>$100,000 to carry the current business. They will purchase
such a foundry, taking title in the Lorin French
Labor Aid Company in trust, and will select a general
manager, who will employ and discharge men, fix the
rate of wages and hours of labor, and have full charge
of the works. After the indebtedness of the Foundry
Company to the Aid Company shall have been fully
paid with interest, the members of the Foundry Company
may elect their own general manager, but, until
then, that officer shall be chosen by, and be subject to
the control of, the directors of the Aid Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each man employed in the works, from the general
manager to the lowest-paid helper in the yard, must
be a shareholder, the number of shares to be held by
each being regulated by his wages. If a workman
should die, or leave employment, either on his own
motion or because of his being discharged, his shares
would be turned over to his successor, who would
be required to make good to the outgoing man or his
widow or heirs whatever amount had been paid upon
the shares, and the money for such payment might
be advanced when necessary out of a fund for such
purpose provided by the Foundry Company, the
shares standing as security for the advance. No
shares could be transferred except to a successor—employed
in the foundry.</p>

<p class='c007'>A portion, say one-fourth, of the shares of the corporation
should be reserved for allotment to workmen
whose employment might be required by the growth
of the works, though it will be the object of the directors
of the Lorin French Labor Aid Company to encourage
the continued organization of new co-operative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>labor corporations rather than the enlargement of
old ones. Yet such encouragement must be prudently
granted, having reference to the natural growth of
business and the demands of a healthy trade, and overproduction
must not be stimulated, for it is my main
purpose to help the laborer to rid himself of the payment
of high interest and large commissions, to bring
him as nearly as possible in direct communication
with the consumer, to save him the waste of strikes,
and the salaries of the brawlers who foment difficulties
between laborers and their employers, to make him
his own employer and his own capitalist, to encourage
him in sobriety and thrift and the possession of such
high manhood as of right belongs to citizenship of our
republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capital stock of such an iron-workers’ co-operation
might be fixed at the sum borrowed from the
Lorin French Labor Aid Company, say $1,000,000,
divided into shares of the par value of $10 each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, five hundred men properly managed, working
industriously, and allowing one-fourth of their
wages and their entire profits to accumulate, might be
able in five years to own a plant of the actual value of
$1,000,000, with the good-will of a business worth as
much more, and thereafter the worker might receive
full wages and an additional income from dividends,
which, if placed in endowment insurance, or in similar
safe investments, would enable him to retire, if he wish,
in fifteen years with an assured competence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The $20,000,000 which will be received from the
sale of my property, all of which I hereby give, devise,
and bequeath to the Lorin French Labor Aid Company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>ought to, and I doubt not will, be sufficient to
establish co-operative iron foundries, sawmills, woolen
factories, glass works, brick yards, and other industrial
enterprises, in San Francisco, sufficient to provide
remunerative employment for fifteen thousand men.
The fund will be invested safely, for it will be based
upon the security which is the creator and conservator
of all property and property rights, industrious and
intelligent labor. The accretions to the fund, even at
the moderate rate of interest of three per cent per
annum, will add, probably, a thousand workers each
year to the number of its beneficiaries, while the repayment
and re-investment in similar ways of the
original fund, will add several thousand more each year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical operation of the plans I have endeavored
to outline will work no injustice to the owners of
existing manufacturing establishments, for it will be in
the interest of the workmen to purchase such plants
and business at their value, rather than to build up
new and rival establishments. It is true that some
persons now making a profit off the labors of others
will be compelled to enlist their capital and energies
in other lines; but this, if a hardship, will not be an injustice,
and individual convenience must be subservient
to the general good.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I have made clear the purposes to which I
hereby devote the fortune I have accumulated by fifty
years of toil and care—yet in the accumulation of
which I have found great enjoyment. The details of
my plans I must leave to those who now are, or who
hereafter may be, charged with the execution of this
trust. In the life upon which I am about to enter—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>I have never so questioned the wisdom of the Originating
and Ultimate Force of the Universe as to suppose
that the death of this body of flesh will be the end of
all conscious individual existence—in the life upon
which I am about to enter, I hope to derive satisfaction
from the fulfillment of the objects of this my last will
and testament, to which I hereby affix my signature
and seal, this thirtieth day of April, eighteen hundred
and ninety-four.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The voice of the clerk ceased, and for a few seconds
there was a hush in the court room, which was
broken by the harsh, cold tones of Counselor John
Lyman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I submit to your Honor,” said he, “in behalf of
the Public Administrator for whom I appear, and who
asks that he be accorded administration of the estate
of Lorin French. I submit that this so-called will,
although rhetorically and otherwise a very interesting
attempt at unpractical philanthropy, is—as a will—simply
waste paper. In spirit and in letter it is an
utter violation of two sections of the civil code of California.
Section 1275 of that code provides that ‘corporations—except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>those formed for scientific, literary,
or educational purposes—cannot take under a will,
unless expressly authorized by statute.’ The proposed
Lorin French Labor Aid Company is, in its plan, a
corporation, neither scientific, literary, nor educational.
Considered as a benevolent corporation, it is
not now in existence, and is, of course, not authorized
by statute to receive this, or any bequest—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is it,” interrupted Mr. Bruff, “that the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the
Sisters’ Hospital, and other corporations, have received
bequests?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Simply because they have been expressly authorized
by act of the Legislature to do so,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then if I wish to leave a sum of money to found
and support an asylum for one-lunged lawyers, or
one-eyed baseball umpires, I am unable to do so, am
I?” said Bruff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can go to Sacramento and have a law passed
to enable your one-eyed and one-lunged corporations
to take your bequest,” said Lyman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much,” said Bruff, sarcastically, “would I
probably be obliged to pay the statesmen for passing
such a law?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My party is not in power,” rejoined Lyman. “I
do not know the latest market quotations for votes in
your caucus.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Order, gentlemen, order,” said his Honor, grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And suppose,” said Bruff, “the Legislature were
not in session, would it be necessary that I wait a year
or two before I could make a valid will, with the
chance of dying in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Possibly,” replied Lyman, “you might make a
bequest to a corporation not empowered at the time
of such bequest, to receive it, but which might subsequently
be expressly authorized by statute to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have led my learned friend to the very point
desired,” said Bruff. “Why, then, I ask him, can the
corporation which the will of Lorin French proposes
shall be created, not be authorized by the California
Legislature, at its next session, to receive his bequest?
I do not apprehend that the most docile Democratic
lamb, or the most fearless Republican boodle hunter,
would dare to refuse his vote for such a law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the corporation proposed by the late Lorin
French,” said Lyman, “is not only unempowered to
receive, it is not yet in existence as a corporation. It
may never be created, and a bequest to either a natural
or an artificial being, not even quickened with incipient
life, not even conceived at the time of the bequest,
may be questioned as of doubtful validity. But it is
profitless to discuss these questions, because there is
another section of the civil code which disposes completely
of this so-called will. I refer to section number
1313. Thirteen is certainly an unlucky number
for the workers of San Francisco. By that section it
is provided that no will devising property for charitable
or benevolent uses, shall be valid unless made at least
thirty days before the death of the testator, and that
in no event can a man bequeath more than one-third
of his estate for such purpose, if he have natural
heirs. It is also provided that all dispositions of
property made contrary to the statute shall be void,
and the property go to the residuary legatee, next of
kin, or heir, according to law.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“That was one of the wise laws that the sand-lot
statesmen gave us,” said Bruff, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Deed, and it wasn’t a sand-lot law at all,” interrupted
a stalwart, red-bearded attorney with a slight
Milesian accent. “It was passed away back in the
seventies. Old Moriarty was down with typhoid fever,
and Father Gallagher was pressin’ him every day to
save his soul by lavin’ his millions to the Jesuit College
and Hospital. But before the priest could get the old
man in condition, Mike Moriarty slipped Nat Bronton—the
king of the lobby—up to Sacramento with $20,000
rint money that Mike collected while his father
was ill, and the bill was rushed through under suspinsion
of the rules. Two days after the bill became a
law, Father Gallagher coaxed and dhrove old Moriarty
into signing a will that cut Mike off wid $50,000, and
left $3,000,000 to the church, and the next week they
buried the old man, with masses enough to put him
through purgatory in an express train. They say
that there was a scrappin’ match between Father Gallagher
and Mike when the priest found that he had been
outgeneraled, and Mike lost the top of his left ear,
but he saved his father’s estate. Sure, the whole case
is reported in the fortieth California, under the title of
the Society of Jesus against Moriarty, and it decides
this will of French’s sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ripple of laughter which this interruption
provoked had subsided, Mr. Lyman resumed:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“My learned friend Casey is right, your Honor; the
case he quoted does decide this one. If this will had
been made more than thirty days before the death of
Mr. French, it could at most have disposed of but one-third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>of his property. But it was made only two days
before his death, and, under section 1313 of the code,
is utterly void,” and the speaker resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court turned to the attorney who had offered
the will for probate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you to say to this, Mr. Bruff?” he inquired.
“All the claimants for the estate will doubtless
agree with the position taken by the attorney for the
public administrator. They are joined in interest in
overturning the will. You alone defend the beneficent
purposes of the dead man. What have you to say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can I say, your Honor?” said Bruff, bitterly.
“It is another instance of a man conceited and obstinate
enough to attempt making his own will. If my
old friend French had called me in, I would have told
him that courts and juries in California seldom allow a
man to dispose of his own estate, if it be a large one,
and he must give his savings away in his lifetime if
he wishes to prevent his sixth cousins from rioting on
them. I would have had Lorin French convey his
vast property to trustees to carry out his plans, and
have affected the transfer completely while he was yet
alive. But he, great and simple soul, supposed, naturally
enough, that he had a right to do as he pleased
with his own, and that, being without near kindred,
and no person having any claim upon him, he could
help the poor with the money it had taken him half a
century to accumulate. He was originally educated
to the law, and, although he had been out of practice
for thirty years, he knew how to formulate a will.
But he was not aware of the ravages committed by a
California Legislature among the time-honored principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of the common law. Mark the result of legislative
folly and individual inadvertence. Twenty millions
of dollars, which their owner proposed to devote
to a grand and comprehensive experiment for adjusting
the vexed relations of labor and capital, will now
be consumed in court costs and witness fees, divided
among a horde of attorneys, and finally scattered in
selfish enjoyment, and in ways unuseful to man, all
over the world from Australia to Elko. It’s the law,
I suppose, and neither your Honor nor I can help it,
but it’s an accursed shame, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mr. Bruff, pale with excitement, resumed his
seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Court can not only pardon your emphatic
language, Brother Bruff,” said his Honor, “but indorses
it. If I could discover any loophole which
might be crawled through, or any way by which I
could break down or climb over the legislative barrier,
and validate the bequest of Lorin French, I would
certainly do so. I will reserve for further consideration
the question of the validity of the legacies to the
wounded, and the families of those killed in the riot.
I am inclined to think that portion of the will may be
good, and so carry with it the right of Louis Browning
to letters testamentary. For the present, however,
I am reluctantly compelled to sustain the objection of
the attorney for the public administrator, and refuse
the will admission to probate. It is ordered accordingly.
Mr. Clerk, note the exception of Mr. Bruff to
my ruling. I will take my summer vacation now, and
go fishing. I shall adjourn court for one month, and
the further hearing of this case for two months. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the meantime, if the gentlemen who represent the various
applicants for letters of administration, will leave
their papers with the clerk, I will, upon my return,
give them careful attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does your Honor desire that I leave all my papers?”
queried the sepulchral-voiced Lester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All,” replied his Honor and he paused for a moment,
and glanced at the ninety pages of manuscript
lying in front of counsel learned in the law, “all except
your brief, Mr. Lester.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The proceedings of the day in the superior court
were reported fully, and commented upon freely, by
the newspapers throughout the country, and a fortnight
afterwards the proposed executor of the rejected
will received the following letter:—</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c012'>[From the <cite>New York World</cite>, July 15, 1895.]</h3>

<p class='c014'>Manhattan Island, west of Broadway and south of
Trinity Church, was, during the last century, occupied
by the substantial mansions of the ancient Knickerbockers,
and as late as the first third of the present
century was not relinquished as a place of residence
by people of aristocratic pretensions. Before the civil
war, the annual fairs of the American Institute were
held in Castle Garden, within whose walls Grisi and
Mario and Jenny Lind sang, and on summer afternoons
children, accompanied by nursemaids, romped
upon the grass under the grand old trees on the Battery.
Then the Bowling Green Fountain, with its
picturesque pile of rocks, was still an ancient landmark;
and the goat pastures above Fifty-ninth Street
were being cleared for the planting of Central Park.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the war the few remaining occupants of pretentious
residences fled to the northward of Madison
Square, and the sightliest and most picturesque portion
of New York City was abandoned to saloons,
emigrant boarding houses, warehouses, and shops, for,
unlike the down-town section east of Broadway, it
was not invaded and colonized by bankers, brokers,
and importing houses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Mr. David Morning, now widely known as the Arizona
Gold King, selected this portion of New York
City for the experiment of organizing pleasant and
economical home lives for a class of dwellers in cities
not ordinarily the subject of elemosynary effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poverty of the very poor, who sometimes lack
even for food or shelter, is hardly more distressing
to the sufferers than the poverty of men who struggle
to maintain a respectable position upon incomes inadequate,
even with the most economical management,
to meet their expenses. How is a married man, having
an income of one, two, or even three thousand
dollars per annum, derived from work which must be
performed by him, as clerk, journalist, physician, or
lawyer, upon Manhattan Island, to live there with
such surroundings as are befitting his education and
position?</p>

<p class='c007'>He will be compelled to pay one-third or one-half
of his income for a flat; an entire house is out of the
question, unless he betake himself to such a locality
in the city as will exile his family from social consideration.
If he live in the suburbs, he must arise at
daylight and stumble along unlighted lanes to the
railroad station, and pass two or three hours of his
time each day standing in a crowded ferryboat, or
hanging to the straps of a jammed car, alternately
frozen and roasted, and always stifled with the reeking
perfume of unventilated vehicles and unsavory
fellow-travelers, for while it may be true that all men
are politically equal, they are not always equally well
washed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alternative is to bring up his family in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>brawl and small scandal of a boarding house. His
wife requires always a certain amount of dresses and
bonnets to maintain herself in a respectable position
in the estimation of her friends, and dresses and bonnets
entail an uncertain amount of expenditure. A
man’s tailor will inform him in advance exactly how
much his garment will cost, and one can contract
for a bridge across the Mississippi at an agreed sum,
but there is no force known in nature that will induce
or drive a dressmaker into foregoing an opportunity
for advantage taking, or persuade her to fix in advance
a price for the making and trimming of a gown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The married bookkeeper or salesman on a salary
in New York City, is forever upon the ragged edge
of embarrassment, unable to save the amount of the
payments necessary for adequate life insurance, or to
provide a fund for a rainy day. The laborer or
mechanic who earns six hundred to nine hundred dollars
per annum is, in comparatively easy circumstances,
for he can live in a tenement house in a cheap
neighborhood without loss of caste, and caste is of
almost as much consequence in free America as in the
Punjaub.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some thought, Mr. David Morning devised a
trial scheme for the relief of married men of small incomes,
whose duties required their daily presence in
New York City, below Canal Street, and in the autumn
of 1894 his agents began to quietly purchase the real
estate between Rector Street and the Battery, and
bounded by Greenwich Street and the Hudson River.
Some months were consumed in the acquisition of
title to the realty, and in a few instances long prices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>were exacted by sagacious and selfish owners, who
held out until the others had sold, but the bulk of the
property was purchased at about its value, and the
brokers were finally instructed to close with all persons
willing to sell, without haggling as to price.</p>

<p class='c007'>It required about $15,000,000 to complete the purchase,
and for this sum sixteen hundred lots were
secured of the orthodox dimensions of twenty-five by
one hundred feet each. Electric lights turned night
into day, and several thousands of men and hundreds
of vehicles, divided into three armies of eight-hour
workers, were at once employed in the work of demolition.
Temporary railroad tracks were laid from
the land to the North River piers, and the material
and débris not needed to fill cellars and vaults was
carried on cars to barges, which were towed to the
Jersey flats, where their contents were dumped upon
ground previously acquired by Mr. Morning for that
purpose, and by the first of February, 1895, the lower
part of Manhattan Island west of Greenwich Street
was as bare as a picked bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work, although generally prosaic, was not
without its romantic and interesting incidents. In a
stone house on Greenwich Street, which was once the
colonial mansion of Diedrich Von Wallendorf, a
walled chamber was opened. The rugs and hangings
it had contained were fallen to shreds, but the
Queen Anne cabinets, tables, and bedstead were in as
good condition as when the room was closed with solid
stone masonry, two centuries ago, without any reason
now apparent for the strange proceeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the cellar floor of another house an earthen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“crock” was found filled with sovereigns, coined in the
last century, and through the destruction of an old
wall cabinet, there came to light a package of letters
from Lord North to Sir Henry Clinton, letters which
indicated that the British Ministry of that day had
been in negotiation with other patriot leaders than
Benedict Arnold for a surrender of the revolutionary
cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The consent of the city authorities to a resurvey
and remodeling of the streets and avenues of the destroyed
section of New York, was obtained without
difficulty since Mr. Morning was now the sole owner
of the land affected thereby, and the rearrangements
proposed by him were made at his own cost, and insured
greater uniformity and greater convenience to
the public than those which were superseded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The land was platted into blocks four hundred feet
in length and eighty feet in width, running north
and south, thus giving to the occupants of the new
buildings either the morning or the afternoon sun.
These blocks are divided by streets of a uniform width
of one hundred feet, having a park thirty feet wide in
the center of each street, with lawn, shrubs, ornamental
trees, and a fountain in the center of each
block. Gas, water, and sewer pipes, and electric
light and pneumatic tubes, have been laid in the new
streets, and by means of a powerful pumping engine,
erected on the Battery, the sewers are flushed every
day with sea water. The new streets are paved with
asphalt, with sidewalks of cement. The city received
from Morning land at the foot of Canal Street purchased
by him, in exchange for Castle Garden and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>vicinage, and the Battery—filled with fountains, statues,
and increased acreage of lawn and garden—is
restored to its ancient functions, and more than its ancient
glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The buildings erected upon each of the one hundred
blocks thus created, are of uniform size and
style. Each building—occupying an entire block—is
four hundred feet long, eighty feet wide, and seventeen
stories high. The roofs are covered with glass,
making the structures eighteen stories aboveground.
One-half of the area of the eighteenth story in each
block is laid out in plots filled with ten feet of rich soil
in beds of perforated cement, the other half in broad
walks of plate glass—guarded by copper netting—so
as to admit light to the seventeenth story and to the
large air shafts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In each of the buildings are one hundred and fifty
suites of five rooms, each suite having a floor area of
sixteen hundred square feet, and every room having
an outlook upon the street. A broad hall runs
through the center of the building on every floor,
lighted by means of plate-glass windows at each end,
and also by three shafts, one hundred feet apart, running
from cellar to roof. Every room is provided
with steam, dry, and gas heat, and with gas and incandescent
lights. Each suite has a household pneumatic
tube service connecting with the store rooms in the
basement, and with the kitchen and dining rooms in
the seventeenth story. Each suite has also a cooking
closet, with gas range, hot water, and steam pipes,
porcelain-lined sinks, and pneumatic tubes for carrying
away garbage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Six hydraulic elevators furnish ample accommodations
for reaching every floor at any hour of the day
or night. A network of perforated steel pipes is concealed
in the walls and floors, with separate connections
for each room with the great tanks on the roof,
which are in turn connected both with the Croton water
system, and with the great steel water main bringing
water from Rockland Lake. In case of fire the walls
and floors of one room, or of any number of rooms,
can instantly be saturated with water, and twice in
each week, at an appointed hour, a warm, gentle rain
is made to descend for a sufficient length of time upon
the trees and shrubs in the roof garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each suite has separate sewer connections, and each
room is provided with registers in the wall, from which
either hot air or cold air can be turned on or off at
will, the hot air ascending from the furnaces, and the
cold air being forced by a pumping engine from the
refrigerating room in the basement. Those whose
fate it has been to swelter on Manhattan Island in the
dog days can appreciate the latter luxury. The fortunate
occupant of a room in one of the Morning
Blocks commands his temperature. Whether the
thermometer registers thirty degrees below or one
hundred degrees above zero outside, he can arrange
the climate in his own room to suit himself, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater
familias</span></i> can connect a wire with the register in the
parlor, and, if “Cholly” protracts his visits to Gladys
to an improper hour, he can shut off the hot air, turn
on a current from the refrigerator, and in ten minutes
make the young man choose between departure and
congealment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>These buildings were planned for the relief of
women. The great source of waste and care in our
American domestic life is in the kitchen, and it is impossible
to organize a more advantageous trust for
both producer and consumer than a “kitchen trust.”
The daily history of every American family is one of
almost unavoidable waste. In food, in fuel, in the
labor of cooking, and in many other details of housekeeping,
there is uneconomic use of both labor and
materials. Probably one-fourth of the expenditure
of every American householder who is able to keep
one or more servants is unnecessary and wasteful,
and where only one servant, or none at all, is employed,
the health and beauty and life of the wife are
expended in kitchen drudgery, and her opportunities
of growth and culture are lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Morning Blocks were designed as theaters of
experiment, which, if successful, will be copied elsewhere,
for freeing the household from the waste and
vexation and tyranny of the kitchen. Mr. Morning’s
plan for bringing about this beneficent result is both
simple and effective. The kitchen, or general cooking
room for the block, is situated in the seventeenth
story, where there is one large, and one hundred
and fifty small dining rooms. Each dining room is
lighted either from the street or the roof, is perfectly
ventilated, and has an electric bell and pneumatic
tube service connecting it with the kitchen, with the
market house in the basement, and with the suite of
apartments below, of which it is an adjunct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The happy householder in one of the Morning
Blocks will have his choice of methods. He and family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>may take their meals at the restaurant or general dining
room in the seventeenth story, either by the carte,
meal, or week. He may use the general dining room,
or his private dining room, or dine in his apartments
below—the pneumatic tube service extending to all, and
a private waiter will be furnished at a fixed price per
hour. He can purchase cooked provisions by weight,
delivered at either place, or purchase his own supplies
at the market house in the basement and have them
cooked in the general kitchen, or use his own cooking
closet, where, without waste of fuel—gas being used—his
selections may be prepared for the table and served
either there or sent by pneumatic tube to his dining
room above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prices for everything furnished, whether of materials
or labor, are fixed from time to time by the manager,
and all bills are required to be paid every Monday,
on penalty of the tenant losing his privilege of
occupancy. The prices charged are less than those
demanded for similar service or material elsewhere.
An account will be kept of each householder’s disbursements,
and his proportion of the profits made
will be returned to him at the end of the year, according
to the usual co-operative process, the object being
to furnish each occupant of the block with whatever he
needs of food or service at actual cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rent asked for the apartments in the Morning
Blocks has been adjusted upon the basis of paying
taxes, insurance, repairs, and three per cent per annum
upon the capital invested in the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morning has conveyed the one hundred blocks
to the governor of New York, the mayor of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>York City, and the president of the New York Chamber
of Commerce, who, with their official successors,
are made perpetual trustees of this munificent gift.
In the trust deed it is provided that the three per cent
interest on cost, received from tenants, shall be invested
in an endowment fund, payable, with its accumulations,
to the tenant whenever he leaves the building, or to his
widow or legal representative in the event of his death
while a tenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tenant in a Morning Block will be supplied with
hot and cold air, hot and cold water, steam, gas, electric
light, food, and service at actual cost. His rooms
will be provided him at the cost of taxes, insurance,
and repairs, and he and his family will be made the
beneficiaries of a fund, which he will be required to
create for the contingency of his death or departure
from the building. To guard against overcrowding,
no one suite of apartments will be rented to any
family of more than five adults, and no subletting or
hiring of apartments will be permitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of the land is estimated at $16,000,000,
and of clearing it and erecting the new buildings at
$30,000,000. The taxes, with insurance, repairs, employes,
and such other expenses as are in their
nature incapable of apportionment among the tenants,
will amount to $810,000 per annum. This sum
divided by fifteen thousand, the number of suites of
apartments in the one hundred Morning Blocks, will
give $54 as the annual sum to be paid by each tenant
for his apartments, and he will pay $108 additional
annually toward a fund for his own benefit. In
all he will pay about $14 a month for accommodations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>that it would be difficult to obtain elsewhere for
five times the amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manager of each block will receive a salary of
$3,000 per annum, and will, in the first instance, be selected
by the Board of Trustees, but on the first Monday
of January, 1897, and each year thereafter, the
occupants of each block, by a majority vote, can elect
a manager, who will, however, in the discharge of his
duties, and in the employment of assistants, be subject
to the direction and supervision of the trustees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morning in the trust deed conveying the Morning
Blocks has named the qualifications of tenants as
follows: The applicant must be of good moral character,
married, over the age of twenty-five and under
sixty. He must have been at the time of his application
for more than one year previously in the employment
of some person, firm, or corporation engaged
in a reputable business in the city of New York south
of Canal Street, and be in receipt of a salary of not
less than $1,000 or more than $3,000 per annum. If
a lawyer, physician, dentist, architect, or civil engineer,
author, clergyman, or journalist, his net income
must be of a similar amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>Applicants for suites of apartments must file their
applications and references at the office of the Morning
Blocks prior to 12 o’clock noon on the fifteenth
day of August, 1895. The credentials of all applicants
will be examined and careful inquiry made as to their
habits, characters, and antecedents, and only those will
be accepted as eligible for tenancy who can strictly
comply with the requirements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should there be, as is most likely, approved applications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>in excess of the suites to be rented, the fifteen
thousand who can be accommodated will be selected
by lot, and the others registered, and whenever vacancies
occur a tenant to fill such vacancy will be selected
by lot from the list. Apartments will be
apportioned by lot among the successful applicants.
Tenants will be permitted to exchange apartments by
amicable arrangement, but no transfer of apartments
from a tenant to one who is not a tenant will be permitted.
The tenant can surrender his right to occupy
his apartments at pleasure, but he cannot assign it, or
sublet the whole or any part of the premises accorded
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should six tenants who are heads of families on
any floor make complaint against one of the other
four tenants on that floor that he is obnoxious, and
that in the general interest his tenancy ought to be
terminated, a jury of fifteen tenants of that building,
selected by lot, one from each of the other floors, shall
be made up to try the accused, who shall have opportunity
to cross-examine the witnesses against him, and
to present his defense. The manager shall preside
and preserve order, and if twelve of the fifteen jurors
shall concur in finding that the tenancy of the accused
ought to terminate, he may appeal to the Board of
Trustees, and unless they unanimously exonerate him,
his tenancy must cease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our reporter interviewed Mr. Morning, who was
found at his offices in lower Broadway, and inquired
of that gentleman if it were true, as rumored, that he
intended to erect similar buildings on another part of
Manhattan Island.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“I have secured,” replied that gentleman, “all the
land for a hundred blocks in and about the locality
known as ‘the Hook,’ and I propose the erection of
buildings there that will accommodate forty thousand
families of mechanics and laborers. There will, of
course, be less room for each occupant than in the
blocks just completed, and less expensive arrangements
in many particulars, but the rent and cost of
living will be less, and the premises will be rented and
conducted substantially on the same plan, with only
such difference in rules as may be necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will be the cost of these latter buildings, Mr.
Morning?” said our reporter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With the land, about $30,000,000,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a pity,” commented our reporter, “that every
city in the land cannot count a David Morning among
its citizens, with a gold mine at his command.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mine is not necessary,” said Morning.
“There are a dozen men in every large city of our land
who, without any gold mine, could do what I have
done. I hope,” continued the speaker, “not to be
alone in the work of helping the people both to employment
and homes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None of our millionaires,” said the reporter,
“have thus used their money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be remembered,” rejoined Morning,
“that the very, great fortunes of this country have
mainly been created during the last twenty-five years,
and in the eager and necessarily selfish strife incident
to their acquisition, their owners have not always considered
that their possession is a great trust which
brings with it duties as well as rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“But I see the dawn of a better day and a better
feeling,” continued Mr. Morning. “I hear of many
gentlemen in different parts of the country who are
proposing to use millions for the erection of homes,
and the secure establishment of co-operative industries
for the benefit of the workers of the land. My idea
is that no man should be accorded an unearned dinner
who has refused a chance to earn it, but that it is
the duty of society to provide every man with an opportunity
of earning. Of what value at last is wealth
unless one can use it for the benefit of his fellow-men?
Charon will not transport gold across the Styx at any
rate of ferriage. Of what use is money here except
in one form and another to give it away? No man
can expend on his own legitimate and proper comforts
and pleasures the interest on $1,000,000 at five
per cent per annum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are many men, Mr. Morning, who expend
a good deal more than $50,000 a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not in the sense of personal expenditures. Mansions,
laces, diamonds, furniture, horses, carriages,
and the like are investments rather than expenditures.
Receptions and banquets may be classed with gifts.
He must be an industrious man who can, with his
family, eat, drink, and wear out $50,000 worth each
year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But is there not the pleasure of accumulation itself,
Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose so,” replied that gentleman, “or men
would not pursue it; but it is a cultivated and not a
natural taste. Every man for instance, requires a
pair of trousers and a hat, but after he has acquired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>enough of such articles for the use of himself and his
family for life, and a generous supply for his descendants,
why work the balance of his days to fill warehouses
with trousers and hats? I do not know,” continued
Mr. Morning—and our reporter thought that
there was a deeper shade in his sea-gray eyes—“I do
not know that I shall ever marry, but if I had boys I
would leave them no fortunes larger than would suffice
for a generous support.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you, then,” queried our reporter, “expend
in your own lifetime all the great revenues of the
Morning mine?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All that I can find time, strength, and opportunity
to expend in ways that will help the world,” rejoined
the Arizona Gold King.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>[From the <cite>New York Times</cite>, July 17, 1895.]</h3>

<p class='c014'>Mr. David Morning is engaged in works of apparent
charity, which to many thoughtful men will seem
an injury rather than a benefit to the world. Capitalists
are entitled to receive interest upon their investments,
and if inducement to accumulation be taken
away by the competition of such Utopians as Mr.
Morning, then frugality may cease to be accounted a
virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the whole, wouldn’t it be better for the business
world, and the stability of property and property
rights, if the tenants of the Morning Blocks were compelled
to pay the full rental value of their apartments?</p>

<h3 class='c013'>[From the <cite>New York Socialist</cite>, July 19, 1895.]</h3>

<p class='c014'>Dave Morning is endeavoring to throw dust in the
eyes of the working masses of the country, by erecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>seventeen-story palaces for boodle bookkeepers,
and twenty-story tenement houses for mechanics.
He has filled San Francisco, Chicago, and several
other cities with his humbug Co-operative Labor Aid
Societies. He is evidently plotting for the presidency
in 1896, and expects to reach the White House by a
golden path.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The poor of this country should accept no employment
as a boon, nor consent to engage in any wage-saving
and profit-sharing corporation that will force
them to accumulate, and they should take no such
favors from the rich as cheap rents or free homes.
Let the unnatural accumulations of rich scoundrels be
distributed among the people. No man is honestly
entitled to have or hold anything except the fruits of
his own labor. It would be better for the world, and
for the great cause of socialism which the pseudo
philanthropy of Morning delays and obstructs, if this
Arizona Gold King could be tumbled head first down
one of his own shafts, and his seventeen-story marble-paved
Edens be dynamited out of existence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Morning’s business offices were on the west side
of Broadway, below Trinity Church, but he gave attention
to his large and increasing correspondence in
his rooms at the Hoffman House, where he had a suite
of apartments fronting on Broadway.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest room of the suite had always been reserved
by the proprietors for a private dining room,
but Morning insisted upon its constituting a part of
his suite, and as he permitted the hotel keepers to
name their own price, it was reluctantly surrendered
to him. In this room Morning had a large-sized
phonograph receiver fitted into the wall opposite his
desk, the instrument itself being placed upon a long
table against the partition in the adjacent room. A
cord which swung over the desk was fastened to a
lever connected with an electric motor, also in the
next room.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Morning’s habit each day after breakfast to
seat himself at his desk, open his letters, pull the cord
which started the electric motor, and “talk” his replies
to the phonograph receiver. The instrument
in the next room was arranged to hold a cylinder of
sufficient length to receive a communication an hour
in length. After Morning had completed this portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of his daily labors, it was the duty of his secretary to
remove the cylinders, and place them in other phonographs,
where two and sometimes three clerks received
their contents, and reduced the same to typewriter
manuscript.</p>

<p class='c007'>This simple contrivance had still another use.
Morning knew that there was no such fruitful source
of business difficulties and consequent litigation as
that which emanated from misunderstanding or misrepresentation
of verbal communications. He endeavored,
therefore, to conduct all important business conversations
in this room, and all the utterances of either
party were recorded by the faithful and unerring
phonograph, and the cylinders upon which they were
reported were properly labeled, dated, and stored
away. He did not fail in any instance to inform the
person with whom he was conversing that all their
words were thus finding accurate record.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day in October, 1895, while Morning was in
Chicago—where he had gone to perfect the organization
of a Labor Aid Corporation—the great financier,
Mr. Arnold Claybank, stopped at the Hoffman House
on his way down town, and ordered a choice dinner
for three to be served at seven o’clock that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And have it served in the room fronting upon
Broadway, where we always dine,” said the millionaire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very sorry, Mr. Claybank,” answered the clerk,
“but that room is at present rented to Mr. David
Morning, as a part of his suite, and when he is in
town he uses it as a room in which to receive and
answer his correspondence; at present he is in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“If he is in Chicago,” replied the Wall Street
magnate, “you can have our dinner served in the
room as usual. It will not disturb him, certainly, even
if he should know of it, and he is not likely to know of
it unless you tell him. I have dined in that room
with my friends at least once a week during the last
twenty years, and, not supposing you would ever rent
it for other purposes, I have already invited them to
meet me there this evening. I don’t like to change,
in fact, I won’t change, and if you will not accommodate
me I will take my patronage elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After some hesitation, the clerk agreed to have dinner
served in the room desired, and at seven o’clock
that evening Mr. Arnold Claybank, with his guests,
Mr. Isaiah Wolf and Mr. John Gray, assembled to
discuss both the menu and the subject of their gathering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not until the last course was removed, the Burgundy
on the table, the cigars lighted, and the waiter
excused from further attendance, did the great capitalists
approach the real object of their meeting. Mr.
Claybank observed that they might need writing
materials, and, stepping to Morning’s desk, he seated
himself thereat, and pulled what he supposed to be a
bell cord that would summon a waiter. No waiter
appeared in answer to the supposed summons, and
Claybank, taking a notebook and pencil from his
pocket, remarked that they would serve his purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>These three gentlemen had dined well, and should
have been in a pleasant frame of mind toward the
world, for good dinners are, or ought to be, humanizing
in their tendencies. Yet there are natures which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>will remain unaffected even by terrapins, Maryland
style, and roasted canvas-back duck, assimilated with
the aid of Lafitte and Pommery Sec., and no tigers
crouching in the jungle were ever more merciless and
conscienceless in their rapacity than these three black-coated
capitalists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Arnold Claybank was the leading spirit of the
conclave. His wealth was popularly estimated at
$100,000,000. He had inherited none of it. At
thirty-five years of age he was a dry goods merchant
in an interior city in Ohio, possessed of less than
$100,000. During his frequent visits to New York to
purchase goods he was in the habit of “taking a flyer”
in the stock market. These flyers proved so continuously
successful, and added so largely to his capital,
that in a few years he closed out his dry goods business,
removed permanently to the metropolis, bought
a seat in the stock board, and soon became known as
one of the boldest and shrewdest operators in the
street.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was rapid and usually accurate in judgment,
and always possessed of the courage of his convictions.
He was as cunning as the gray fox, to which he was
often likened. He was suave in manner but merciless
in the execution of his plans. He was identified in
the public mind with several of the boldest and most
unscrupulous operations in the history of Wall Street,
and his millions had steadily and rapidly increased,
until now, at sixty years of age, he was one of the
acknowledged kings of New York finance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isaiah Wolf was, as his name indicated, of Hebrew
origin. He was about the same age as Claybank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and had many of the qualities of that gentleman,
lacking, however, his courage and his quickness of
comprehension and movement. He was a gambler
by birth, education, and instinct, and a gambler who
never failed to use all advantages possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirty years before he had been a clothing merchant
and dealer in city, county, and legislative warrants
at Portland, Oregon. He furnished the impecunious
legislators, when they came down from the
mountain counties, with an outfit of clothing; he discounted
their salaries at three per cent per month; he
was usually the custodian of the lobby funds, and he
could always introduce senator or assemblyman to a
quiet game of “draw,” where, whenever a huge
“pot” was in dispute, Isaiah could usually be found
safely entrenched behind the winning hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Comstock mines began to yield their
great output of silver in 1875–77, the Wolf Brothers
located in San Francisco, made their homes on
Pine and California Streets, and gambled in mining
stocks from the vantage-ground of secret knowledge,
for in every mine were one or more miners under pay,
not only from the mining company, but from Isaiah
Wolf. In 1879, when the transactions in the stock
board of San Francisco had dwindled to a tithe of
their former magnitude, and when the sand-lot agitators
succeeded in grafting their ideas of finance
and taxation upon the organic law of California,
Isaiah Wolf and his brother Emanuel gathered their
assets together and joined the exodus of millionaires.
In New York City they opened a bankers’ and brokers’
office, and were now accounted as jointly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>possessors of $80,000,000, the management of which
was left almost exclusively to Isaiah.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Gray was an insignificant-looking old man of
seventy. From his unkempt beard, watery eyes,
shrinking manner, and small stature, he might have
been taken for a congressional doorkeeper who had
seen better days. In truth, there was, under his ignoble
exterior, one of the broadest, wiliest, and best-informed
minds in America. He was the acknowledged leader
of Wall Street in ability and resources. His wealth
was estimated at quite $150,000,000, and it had been
created by himself in about forty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began life as a Vermont peddler, but at the age
of twenty-five carried his New England education, his
capacity for calculation, his retentive memory, his
frugal habits, and his tireless energy into New York
City, where he began as porter and messenger in the
office of a broker. He soon learned the history and
methods of the principal operators of the Wall Street
of that day, and his savings were shrewdly, quietly,
and boldly invested on “points” which he picked up
while delivering messages or awaiting replies. He
soon accumulated a large sum of money, yet he kept
his humble place, and his employer never suspected
when he paid the faithful porter his $40 at the end of
each month, that the quiet and deferential young man
could have purchased not only his employer’s business,
but the building in which it was conducted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gray remained as porter and messenger for five
years, declining all offers which were made to him of
promotion to a desk and a higher salary. The place he
held gave him opportunities which could be obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in no other way. None suspected the quiet and stolid-looking
man, who seemed so dull of comprehension
when any verbal message was intrusted to him; and
words were dropped and conversations held in his
presence which, when fitted by his quick and comprehensive
brain into other words and conversations
held in other offices, often enabled him to forecast
events. The man who by any means is accurately
advised of the real intentions of the leaders of Wall
Street a day or even an hour before their execution,
has a key to wealth, and Gray used this key, conducting
all his operations through one broker, who was
pledged to secrecy.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the great deal in Harlem, so successfully
engineered before the war by Commodore Vanderbilt,
Gray was still occupying his place as messenger.
He overheard a conversation held in the
commodore’s private office between that gentleman
and his confidential clerk, and, comprehending the
magnitude of the opportunity, he directed that all his
resources, which then amounted to nearly $200,000, be
placed in Harlem stock. He was enabled, under the
system of margins which prevailed in Wall Street,
to purchase $2,000,000 worth of the stock, which he
sold at an average advance of fifty per cent, clearing
$1,000,000 by the operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old commodore, who had himself made $6,000,000
by the deal, found that somebody had been
sharing profits with him to the extent of $1,000,000,
and, not supposing that this was the result of guesswork,
he used means to discover who was the cunning
operator and what were the sources of his information.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Without much difficulty he traced the transactions to
John Gray, and, remembering the presence of that
young man in the anteroom at the time of giving
directions to his confidential clerk, he was not at a
loss to determine how it came about.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commodore considered that Gray had gained
$1,000,000 which should have come to his own coffers,
and he determined to “give the young fellow a lesson,
sir,” as he said to his confidential clerk. That morning
Gray’s employer received—to his great surprise—a
call from Vanderbilt, who, to his greater surprise, informed
him of the true status of his messenger, who
had become a millionaire. Gray’s employer readily
promised to assist in the scheme which Vanderbilt
formed for punishing Gray and “stripping him of his
ill-gotten gains, sir.” Vanderbilt required only that
Gray’s employer should next day send Gray to Vanderbilt’s
office, with a verbal message, inquiring,
“What is to be done about Erie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Gray called and delivered his message
to the commodore in his private office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take a seat, young man, until I can write a reply,”
was the direction, and Gray deferentially seated himself
upon the edge of a chair, and gazed at the carpet
stolidly, while the commodore penned the following:
“Buy all the Erie offered at market rates up to fifty-three.
C. V.” This note the commodore placed in an
envelope, which he directed, but apparently forgot to
seal, and handed it to Gray, who thereupon departed.
As the door closed behind the messenger, the veteran
bull smote himself upon the sides, and threw his head
back and laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Gray noticed that the envelope was not sealed, and
before he reached the bottom of the stairs, he possessed
himself of its contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he fell into a train of thought. Erie was selling
at $37, and Gray was thoroughly posted as to
the resources, liabilities, and business of the road,
and knew very nearly who were the principal stockholders.
He knew that the commodore held fully
one-third of the capital stock of Erie, which had cost
him not more than $30 a share, and he also knew that
the old gentleman had been for some time selling his
stock at $37 as fast as he could do so without breaking
the market. Thirty-seven was really a nursed
price for the stock; it was more than the condition
and prospects of the road warranted, and Gray did
not believe that Vanderbilt intended to purchase any
great quantity, even at $37, or that it would be possible
for him to run the stock to $53 without purchasing
the entire amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gray delivered the note to his employer, and asked
that gentleman if he might be excused for half an hour
to attend to some matters of business of his own.
Leave of absence was graciously granted, and Gray
was watched to the door of the office of the broker
who had bought and sold his Harlem stock. Then
Gray’s employer walked to the office of the expectant
commodore and informed him that the young man
had swallowed the bait, for he had gone to the office
of his broker, probably to order large purchases of
Erie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vanderbilt thanked the broker, assured him that in
the division of the spoils he should not be forgotten,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and authorized him in furtherance of their project to
purchase all the Erie offered up to $42, to which figure
Vanderbilt proposed to run the stock before letting
it drop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gray directed his broker to purchase Erie in one-hundred-share
lots, beginning at $37, and to follow the
market up to $53 if it reached that figure, but not to
purchase more than five thousand shares in all. Having
given this direction, he walked into the back office
of a firm of brokers, who, although leaders in the market,
had never succeeded in obtaining any business
from Vanderbilt, and between them and that gentleman
there was a business feud of long standing. The quiet
messenger was well known to the head of the firm,
who greeted him pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can I do for you, Gray,” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would like to take your time for not more than
five minutes,” said Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am pretty busy,” said the gentleman, “but I
will try and oblige you,” and he led the way to an
inner office.</p>

<p class='c007'>The broker’s eyes distended with astonishment as
Gray rapidly told how he had made such use of his
opportunities as porter and messenger as to accumulate,
by speculation, a large sum of money, and that
he desired now to employ their firm in an operation
which, for reasons of his own, he did not care to intrust
to his regular broker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentleman smilingly agreed to accept Mr.
Gray’s business, and opened his eyes still wider when
Gray took from his pockets large packages containing
bonds and securities to the amount of half a million
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>dollars, and, depositing them as collateral, directed
the broker to sell all the Erie for which he
could find buyers at forty and over, and to buy it whenever
it went below thirty-three.</p>

<p class='c007'>That day Erie mounted, under the pressure of Vanderbilt’s
purchases, and the flurry created thereby, to
$43, at which figure an immense quantity changed
hands. Then it fell rapidly, point by point, back to
$37, and, under the influence of a temporary panic,
went down to $32, at which figure it rallied and
mounted to $35, where it stood at the close of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gray’s regular broker reported to him purchases
of five thousand shares Erie at prices ranging
from $37 to $42, and averaging about $39. He regretted
that Mr. Gray had not authorized a sale at
$43.25, which was the highest point reached, and at
closing figures Mr. Gray must lose about $20,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mr. Gray’s new brokers reported to him sales
of eighty thousand shares of Erie, at an average of
$41.50, which had been repurchased at an average
of $34.50, with a profit to Mr. Gray of $540,000,
which they held, subject to his check.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when the returns were all in at the office of the
old commodore, and that white-whiskered, choleric,
kind-hearted, and courageous old bull found that he
owned more Erie than ever, at higher prices than
those for which he had sold a small part of his holdings,
and that the rattan which he had prepared for
Gray had fallen upon his own shoulders, he stormed
for a while and clothed himself with cursing as with a
garment, and then he cooled off and laughed. Then
he sent a note, this time not to John Gray’s employer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>but to John Gray himself, which read as follows:
“Young fellow, you are a genius. Come and dine
with me at six o’clock to-day, at Delmonico’s. C. V.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The friendship cemented at that dinner, between
the great capitalist and the ex-messenger—for Gray
returned no more to his duties as a porter—continued
until the day of the commodore’s death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gray continued to operate in Wall Street, both in
small and large ways, and seldom made a loss. When
the first loud mutterings of the civil conflict began to
shake the land, he became a heavy purchaser of tar,
resin, and cotton, and, later, of gold. When the
Union armies were defeated and the day looked darkest,
and gold mounted to two hundred and eighty
premium, he never faltered in his belief in the ultimate
triumph of the nation, and he sold gold and
bought government bonds, and margined one against
the other, and risked little and gained much.</p>

<p class='c007'>A year after the sun went down upon Appomattox,
the Yankee peddler was worth $20,000,000, and ten
years later he was worth $50,000,000. He abandoned
such stock operations as were dependent for
their success upon other men’s movements and plans,
and only engaged in such as he could absolutely control.
He gambled only with marked cards and
loaded dice. He bought a control of the stocks and
bonds of badly-managed and bankrupt railroads. He
consolidated them, re-equipped them, built feeders,
opened new sources of traffic, and so doubled, trebled,
and quadrupled his investments. He sold short the
stock of a prosperous railroad, and obtained, by purchase
of proxies, the control of its management. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>cut rates, diminished traffic, enlarged expenses, and
passed dividends until he depreciated the value of the
stock to a point where he could gain millions by covering
his shorts, and other millions by again restoring
the road to prosperity. In one instance, by his
paid emissaries, he promoted a general strike, until,
through riot and fires and suspension of traffic, the
stock of the afflicted corporation was depreciated to
the price at which he desired to purchase a controlling
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Gray was an exemplary father and husband, a
good neighbor, and, in a small way, generous and
charitable; but in his larger dealings with mankind
he was a moral idiot, without conscience or perception.
The world is no better for his life; the youth of
the land are the worse for his example of successful
scoundrelism, and those who wish well to their country
and their kind, will have a right to stand beside
his coffin and thank God that he is dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose,” said Mr. Arnold Claybank, “that we
all understand the general outlines of our project, and
that this meeting is for the purpose of talking over
details.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our purpose,” said Mr. Wolf, “of I gomprehent
it, is to use the bower dot we haf in our hants, to
make for ourselves about fifty millions of tollars
apiece. Is not dot apout vot it vas, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We need not, I think, discuss that question,” said
Gray suavely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly,” said Claybank. “Now I propose that
we list the securities which we shall place in our pool,
at the closing quotations of the Stock Exchange to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>each one of us being credited with his contributions.
The stocks contributed will aggregate in value
about $150,000,000, at present market prices, and, as
nearly as possible, will be contributed by us equally.
It is also understood that the stocks and bonds placed
in the pool will constitute the entire holdings of each
and all of us, in that class of property. Am I correct?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite so,” said Mr. Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dot is also my unterstanting,” said Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” resumed Claybank, “these securities
are to be placed in the offices of different brokers, and
turned into cash as rapidly as possible without breaking
the market. The public will, I think, take them
easily in a week, for the market is rising, and permanent
as well as speculative investment is in order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ont then we lock up the gash for which we sells
the stock, ain’t it?” said Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not immediately,” rejoined Claybank, “it must
be left in the banks in the usual channels for a time, or
there will be no money for them to loan to the buyers
of stocks. Having sold our own securities, we will next
proceed to sell short at ruling prices to as large an extent
as possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your plan is admirable,” said Mr. Gray. “We
will next arrange at the banks for borrowing all the
money that they can spare without suspending payment,
and we will compel them to withdraw all loans
now out. Through our joint and separate control of,
and influence with, the officers and directors, we ought
to be able to borrow in this city, and in Boston and
Philadelphia, as much as $150,000,000, which, added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>to $150,000,000 received from sale of our stocks, will
give us control of $350,000,000 in cash.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will dey loan so much as $150,000,000 even
upon the personal security of such men as we?” said
Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They will not be asked to do so,” said Gray.
“The money borrowed can be sealed up and left as
special deposits in their vaults as security for itself,
with a small margin of one or two per cent to cover
interest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dot inderest, of we borrow for thirty days at six
per cent, on $150,000,000 will amount to three kevawters
of a million of tollars; ont that amount we lose out
of our bockets; ont the interest on our own $150,000,000
which will be itle for a month will be another three
kevawters of a million. It makes US$500,000 each to
lose. It is a great teal of money to lose,” said Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” said Claybank, “is all we lose, and is
practically all we risk. It is essential to the success
of our plans that for a brief period we shall withdraw
from the channels of commerce a large portion of the
money of the country. We cannot withdraw it unless
we control it; we cannot control it unless we borrow
it; and we cannot borrow it without paying bank rates
of interest upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How,” said Gray, “do you propose to supply
the necessary margins for the stock which we sell
short? When you borrow stock on a rapidly-falling
market, the loaner expects at some time a reaction,
and an equally rapid advance, and you will have to
give him a pretty big margin beyond the money which
you receive from a sale of the borrowed stock.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“We shall have for that purpose,” replied Claybank,
“the $150,000,000 received from the sale of
our own stock. This, at fifty per cent fall in prices,
will margin borrowings of three hundred millions of
stock, and this money we can arrange to have locked
up in special deposits as well as the money we borrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ont to how low a point shall we put brices before
we commence to cover?” said Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” replied Claybank, “will be a matter for
future consideration. My present impression is that
we can by thus locking up the currency bear the market
one-half. We must not proceed so far as we
might go, or we will ruin everybody, so that there will
be no investors to purchase stocks when we wish to
sell them again after we have loaded up for a rise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ont how much we makes by bearing fifty per
cent?” asked Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is easily calculated,” replied Claybank. “If
our plans succeed, we sell one hundred and fifty millions
of our own holdings at present prices. In order
to bear the market fifty per cent below present prices,
we must continue to sell down, diminishing the quantity
we sell as prices recede, and when we begin to
cover, we must buy all we can at the lowest point,
diminishing our purchases as prices advance. Those
not familiar with such things would be surprised to
know that the ebb and flow of values in the stock
market is almost as regular, and can be almost as certainly
predicted, as the movement of the tides. Such
a movement as we propose is artificial, yet, to an extent,
it will be similarly controlled by the influences of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>human nature. If we sell one hundred and fifty millions
of stock at an average of say one hundred, and
three hundred millions at an average say of eighty,
and buy it all back at an average of sixty, we will gain
one hundred and twenty millions, and that, I think,
is about all we can calculate upon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But have you considered, gentlemen, the other
side of the question?” said Gray. “Have you fully
considered whether there may not exist influences
that will defeat us? Depend upon it, once we inaugurate
this raid, our rivals in business will plot to overthrow
us. Such great newspapers as are not in our
control will denounce us. The Treasury Department
at Washington, which is under the control of the
Farmers’ Alliance party, will use every effort to break
down our combination, and we shall be howled at
generally as ghouls and villains. I do not care much
about the public or the newspapers, but we must take
every possible precaution against failure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right,” said Claybank. “I have considered
all these things and I do not see how our plan
can be defeated. The newspapers may denounce us
but cannot overthrow our plan, which, at last, is very
simple. We produce a panic and depression of prices
by locking up the circulating medium, and prices can
only be advanced by unlocking the money and restoring
it, or other money in its place, to the channels of
commerce. The money which we lock up in special
deposits must remain in the bank vaults until we
release it. No bank officer would for any reason or
under any pressure dare to touch a special deposit.
It would be a penitentiary offense to tamper with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Are you sure,” said Gray, “that other capitalists
may not combine, and provide other money to take
the place of that which we lock up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only other very large sum of money in the
country within the control of anybody,” replied Claybank,
“is $300,000,000 in the treasury vaults at Washington.
The laws authorizing government deposits in
banks, as well as the law authorizing bond purchases
in the discretion of the secretary of the treasury, have,
as you know, been repealed. There are absolutely
but two ways to get that $300,000,000 out of the
treasury vaults. One is by the ordinary disbursements
of government, which would take a year or more, and
the other is by somebody depositing, under the law of
1894, gold or silver bars to that amount, and nobody
in the world is able to command three hundred, or
one hundred, or even fifty millions of dollars in gold
or silver bullion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The new mining capitalist, David Morning, might
supply the bars from his mine in Arizona if we gave
him a few years’ time,” said Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and if we gave him time he would be crank
enough to do it,” replied Claybank. “But we won’t
give him time. How much does his mine yield, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Four millions a month in solit golt,” said Wolf.
“It has yieltet that sum now for teventy months. I
hear that it is nearly worked out, but nopoty can get
into it, and you can’t tell anything apout it. If it continues
to yielt at that rate for a few years, dot fellow is
going to make us all some trupple. He is crazy as a
loon, though he has taken out of his mine over
eighty millons of tollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Even his $80,000,000, if he has them in money,
might disarrange our plans,” said Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has plown them all in, puilding plocks for
glerks ont poor people, ont he disgriminates against
Hebrews, or his trustees do. A Jew knows a goot
thing when he fints it, ont there were eighteen thousant
applications from Jew glerks for the prifilege of
renting apartments in the Morning Blocks, ont the
committee made up a mean drick to get rit of them.
They requiret every man who applied for rooms to
answer whether it was easier to fill to a bob-tail flush
or a sequence, ont those who answered the question
they refused to pass, on the grount that they knew
too much apout draw poker to haf goot moral characters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not see,” said Claybank, after the laughter
at Wolf’s indignation had subsided, “that we need
take Mr. Morning into consideration as a disturbing
element in our present plans. If the present output
of his mine shall continue, it must, by and by, greatly
advance prices of stocks and all other property, but
that is in the future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have we anything further to consider?” said
Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” replied Claybank, rising, “that we
understand each other perfectly. I will have triplicate
memorandums made of our agreement, which we
can execute in my office to-morrow morning at nine
o’clock, where we will have our stocks brought at the
same time. This Burgundy is the genuine article,
Clos Voguet, vintage of 1875. I propose as a parting
toast, ‘Success to our enterprise.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>And the phonograph needle in the adjoining room
wrote in mystic scratches upon the wax, “Success to
our enterprise.” Then came the shuffling of feet, the
sound of a closing door, and the faint buzz of the
electric motor until it ceased, and silence reigned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>David Morning returned to New York three
days after the dinner party described in the last chapter.
His typewriters were in attendance as usual,
and he began opening his accumulated correspondance,
when his secretary knocked at the door communicating
with the next room, and, entering, said to
his employer:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Morning, pardon me for disturbing you, but
will you please step into the phonograph room.
There is a good deal of matter on the cylinders which
has been placed there by others in your absence, and,
I judge, placed there inadvertently. I think you had
better hear it yourself before it is transcribed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning walked into the other room and was for half
an hour an interested auditor of the revelations of the
wonderful phonograph. He directed his secretary
to remove, label, and lock up the cylinders containing
the dinner-party conversation, and said in conclusion:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Stephens, somebody has evidently been having
a dinner party in this room during my absence.
It was not a nice thing for the proprietors to do, but
I shall not notice it. Try to find out who dined
here, without disclosing that I am aware that the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>was occupied. I think I recognize the voices of the
occupants, but I wish to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By inquiring among the waiters, the secretary ascertained,
and reported to Mr. Morning, that the guests
were Claybank, Wolf, and Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night our hero departed for Washington, and
early next morning he was closeted with the secretary
of the treasury, to whom he revealed the knowledge
gathered from the phonograph cylinders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is an infamous piece of business,” said the
secretary warmly, “but what, Mr. Morning, can I do
about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Secretary,” said Morning, “will you pardon
me for saying frankly that it is your duty to baffle
these conspirators and restore values to their normal
condition. It is the business of the government to
provide a supply of money for the needs and uses of
commerce. These scoundrels will bring about a panic
by locking up in the vaults of New York, Philadelphia,
and Boston banks, $300,000,000, which ought to
be in circulation among the people. You have three
hundred millions of coin and paper money in the
treasury. Why not pour this money into Wall Street,
break the back of this conspiracy, and relieve the people?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have no authority, Mr. Morning, as you
must know, to use one dollar of this money for any
other purposes than those designated by law. If I
had the power, believe me, I would be only too glad
to exercise it as you desire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does not the Act of Congress of February, 1894,
known as the free coinage law, permit you, Mr. Secretary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>to substitute gold or silver bars of standard fineness,
for the coined money and paper money in the
treasury vaults?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied the secretary, “but I do not see how
that law can be invoked to relieve the situation.
There are not three hundred millions of gold and silver
ingots in private ownership in the country, or,
probably, in the world. The very large output of
$1,000,000 in gold per week from the Morning mine
will not serve us in this exigency. It would require
six years’ yield of your mine, Mr. Morning, to furnish
enough gold to release the money now in the treasury,
and baffle Messrs. Gray, Claybank, and Wolf.
Three hundred millions of dollars is a good deal of
money, Mr. Morning—a good deal of money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Relatively it is, Mr. Secretary, but I have five
times that sum in gold bars here, in Philadelphia, and
New York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The secretary glanced at the Arizona Gold King,
and looked uneasily at the bell cord which hung
above his desk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am not crazy,” said Morning with a laugh,
“though I do not blame you for thinking so. The
time has come somewhat sooner than I expected for
intrusting you with my secret. The Morning mine
is a phenomenal deposit of gold. It is so large that,
fearing any general knowledge of its extent might
cause demonetization of gold by the nations, I took
measures to conceal its true yield, and for every
ounce of gold which I shipped to New York or London
as the ostensible product of the mine, I shipped
twenty-five other ounces disguised as pig-copper to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>this city, or New York, or Philadelphia, or Liverpool.
In the latter place $1,000,000,000 are stored, and there
are $500,000,000 in each of the American cities I have
named. A month ago I sent four of my trusted men
from the mine to this city, where they have since
been busy with cold chisels, releasing the gold bars
from their copper moulds. They will go from here
to Philadelphia and New York, and thence to Liverpool,
for similar labors. I did not intend, Mr. Secretary,
to offer any of this gold for coinage or sale until
able to present it simultaneously at European and
American mints. But the present exigency induces
me to turn over to the United States for coinage, the
five hundred millions of gold bars now ready for delivery
in this city. I may add, Mr. Secretary, to
quiet the apprehensions which your deep interest in
the commercial prosperity of the country might lead
you to entertain, that I have not intended, and do not
now intend, to throw $2,500,000,000 of new money
immediately into the channels of commerce. I shall
change the gold bars into money at once, in order
that the present value may not, by demonetization,
be taken away from gold; but, once transformed into
money, it will be fed gradually to the world, and not
precipitated upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Mr. Morning, it will require the constant
labor for a long time of the mint and all its branches to
coin this large sum, and you require the money at
once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I propose, Mr. Secretary, to avail myself of the
law of February, 1894, and claim treasury notes for
my ingots. That Act of Congress will enable you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>print in two or three days enough bills of large denomination
to cover the whole sum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You astound me, Mr. Morning, but I suppose I
must believe you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will ride with me to the foot of Sixth Street,
Mr. Secretary, I will exhibit to you $500,000,000 in
gold bars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Mr. Morning, even $500,000,000 suddenly
poured into Wall Street will create a wilder panic
and precipitate worse results, than those which may
come from the pending conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think so,” said Morning quietly. “It
is contraction and not inflation that hurts. A flood
may be disastrous to the crops in places, but a general
drought will surely kill them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Congress were in session, Mr. Morning, it
would be likely to demonetize gold. It would never
suffer fifteen hundred millions of money to be thus
added to the present currency. Why, such an
amount will double at once the entire paper and metallic
money of the country!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Congress is not in session, Mr. Secretary,
and you will pardon me for saying that, whatever
may be your individual opinion as to consequences,
you have no power to refuse to issue gold notes as
fast as you can cause them to be engraved, for any
amount of gold bars that I may offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True,” replied the secretary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I repeat, Mr. Secretary, that I hope to guard
against the evils you apprehend. I should be an unworthy
custodian of the great trust which has come
into my hands, if I could misuse it to harm either my
country or my fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“I believe you, Mr. Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the present I can only use the ingots which
are here in Washington. The New York and Philadelphia
hoards will be ready in about a month, when
I shall require treasury notes for them, but before I
offer them to you, and before their existence shall be
known generally, I shall endeavor to place in the
mints at London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Milan, Vienna,
and St. Petersburg, and in the banks of the
principal cities of Europe simultaneously, in exchange
for metallic and paper money of those countries, the
one thousand millions now in Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The secretary bowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you order three hundred millions of gold
notes, of the denomination of $1,000 each, printed at
once, and arrange to weigh, test, and receive the five
hundred millions of bars in my warehouse at the foot
of Sixth Street? If it be not irregular, you might receive
the ingots where they are, deliver to me at once
the two hundred millions of paper money now in the
treasury vaults, and the remaining three hundred
millions when printed. The gold bars can be removed
to the treasury vaults at your convenience. I
ask that this method be followed because, if I am to
relieve the situation in New York, I must be on hand
there with the actual currency. Ordinarily treasury
drafts would answer the purpose, but, under present
circumstances, they would be useless, as no bank
could cash them, and they are not a legal tender.
These bandits will have locked up all the money in
special deposits, and their well-devised scheme can
only be baffled by one who has—outside of any channel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>within their control, and outside of their knowledge—a
vast sum in actual money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How, may I ask, do you propose to defeat their
plans, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brokers will purchase for cash all the stocks
they offer, and, on deposit of sufficient margin, loan
them the stocks back again, to be again sold to me.
In brief, I will take all their ‘shorts,’ and all the
stocks sold by others which their conspiracy will force
upon the market. When they have forced prices
down to a point where they are ready to cover their
shorts and buy for an advance, I will suddenly jump
prices to the level they occupied before the conspirators
commenced their operations, and thus commend
to their own lips the bitter draught they have prepared
for others. I shall know—for I have many
sources of information, Mr. Secretary—I shall know
what portion of my purchases of stock will come from
the conspirators, and what portion from men who
will be forced by the panic to part with their holdings.
I shall subsequently make good to those others all
their losses. The one or two hundred millions which
I may by this process extract from Mr. Gray, Mr.
Claybank, and Mr. Wolf, I shall not”—and Morning
smiled—“restore to them. I shall devote it to
founding and maintaining industrial schools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your plan, Mr. Morning, is a brave and gigantic
one. Is there no chance of its failure?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I can have your co-operation, Mr. Secretary,
in keeping secret for a week or ten days the fact
that you have, under the law of February, 1894, received
five hundred millions of ingot gold, and issued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>treasury notes therefor. These scoundrels will have
locked up all the available money in the great financial
centers. They know that, under the present law,
the three hundred millions of paper and coin money
in the government vaults cannot be released so as to
flow into the channels of commerce except by deposits
of gold or silver bullion to take its place. My
secret has been carefully kept, and they do not dream
of the existence in private ownership of five hundred
millions, or even fifty millions, in gold bars. If I can
keep this secret from them until the hour to strike
arrives, I will give them a lesson that will cure them
for the future of any disposition to lock up money
and constrict the arterial blood of commerce for the
purposes of private gain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But will not their losses be largely on paper, Mr.
Morning? What if they refuse to pay?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not go into court with them, Mr. Secretary,
and it will not be necessary. Let me further
illustrate. They sell one thousand shares say of
Northwestern at $110, and I buy it. They take the
$110,000 received by them from my broker and add
to it ten or twenty thousand dollars for margin, and
borrow from me the one thousand shares of Northwestern
just sold me, depositing the one hundred
and twenty or one hundred and thirty thousand dollars
as security for the return of the borrowed stock.
When Northwestern, under the pressure of their sales,
descends to $100, they put up additional margin for
the stock borrowed, and borrow more stock on the
same terms. If they continue this process until
they have forced Northwestern down to $80 or $70,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and could then buy enough to replace the borrowed
stock and call in the money they had deposited as
‘margin,’ they would make as profit the difference between
the low price at which they purchased and the
average of their sales. But if Northwestern should
suddenly jump in price to a point higher than the
value to which they had margined it, then my brokers
would purchase, at this high rate, enough Northwestern
to make good the stock loaned to them, using for
that purpose the money deposited by the conspirators
as ‘margin.’ I propose to let these gentlemen have
all the rope they want, and when they attempt to turn
and become buyers, I will spring stocks at once to
their original price, and confiscate all their margins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will aid you, Mr. Morning, as you request, by
keeping our transactions secret as far as possible,
though I can’t promise you success in that. At least
a dozen men will be required to print the gold notes
in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and those
men will know of the issuance of so vast a sum as $300,000,000.
Half a dozen more must know of the removal
of the two hundred millions of paper money
now in the treasury vaults, and at least a dozen men
will be needed to weigh and remove the gold bars from
your warehouse. What is known to thirty men will
soon, I fear, be known to the world. I will detail
only discreet men, who shall work under pledges of
secrecy, the violation of which shall cost them their
places, but, after every precaution shall have been
taken, who shall baffle the ubiquitous newspaper reporter
in search of a ‘scoop’? He will crawl through
the coal hole or the area railings. He will walk with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the cats on the top of spikes and broken bottles. He
will act as a car-driver, a barber, or a purchaser of old
clothing. I verily believe that if he had lived in the
olden days he would have coaxed Cæsar to reveal
the plan of his next campaign, and wrested from the
Egyptian Sphinx her secret. I fear, Mr. Morning,
that the reporters will prove too much for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had some experience in keeping secrets,
Mr. Secretary, and if you will permit me to direct the
details of the movement, I will undertake that no inkling
of it shall reach the ears of the reporters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How will you avoid it, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anticipating your consent and co-operation, Mr.
Secretary, I directed the captain of my steam yacht,
the <em>Oro</em>, to come here from New York without
delay, and by to-night she will be moored in the
Potomac, opposite the warehouse at the foot of Sixth
Street. I propose that, with the officials and men
whose duty it will be to test and weigh the gold bars,
you shall examine them where they are in the warehouse.
You will take the keys and take possession,
and, if you desire, will detail guards for the warehouse
who will not know what they are guarding. As soon
as satisfied of the quality and quantity of the gold, you
will direct the printing of three hundred millions of
treasury notes, and will deliver me the two hundred
millions of paper money now in the treasury
vaults. The three hundred millions can be printed
in bills of the denomination of $1,000, and may be
packed in five good-sized trunks. The $200,000,000
now in the treasury, being in bills of smaller denominations,
will require fifteen trunks for their accommodation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>My four trusted men, who have been busy
here for the past month cutting the gold bars out of
their copper jackets, will procure fifteen trunks of different
makes and marks, and after they have been filled
with currency at the treasury vaults, will carry them
in an express wagon, which I will purchase, to the
railroad depot, and check them for New York in four
different lots, purchasing two or three passage tickets
for New York for each lot of trunks. They will go
as ordinary baggage to New York, and there be taken
to my office on Broadway, without exciting suspicion
or comment. Two of the men will return from New
York here, and a similar plan can be pursued with
the $300,000,000, which will be printed in the meantime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not yet see, Mr. Morning, how you propose
to close the mouths of the treasury officials engaged
in the business here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ask, Mr. Secretary, that for all this work you
will select reliable men, unmarried, and who can be absent
from their places of abode for a fortnight without
comment. Inform each man selected that he will be
employed in a matter requiring secrecy, and that it
will involve an ocean trip. I propose that every man
connected with the transaction, except yourself, Mr.
Secretary, every man, from the official who tests the
gold, to the official who packs the currency into the
trunks, shall, from the time he enters upon the performance
of his duty, until it is completed, remain in
place. I will have food, and, if need be, cots for sleeping
at the warehouse, and the placing of the currency
in the trunks will not require more than an hour or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>two of time. Each man, as he completes his duty, will
go on board the <em>Oro</em>, and when all are on board, the
steamer will put to sea, with orders to cruise for two
weeks and then return here. Each of the gentlemen
taking this voyage will be presented by me with the
sum of $1,000 for his services. The examination and
weighing of the gold bars in the warehouse, and the
packing and shipment of the two hundred millions of
paper money now in the treasury, can, I think, be
completed by to-morrow, and the <em>Oro</em> steam out to-morrow
night, with a passenger list including the
names of all those who have any knowledge of the
fact that two hundred millions of treasury notes are
on their way to New York, and that the government
has $500,000,000 worth of gold bars in its vaults.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how about the three hundred millions of
notes ordered printed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those engaged in the printing can be similarly
detailed, similarly instructed, and similarly dealt with.
I have chartered the <em>New Dominion</em>, now lying at
Norfolk, for a voyage to Port au Prince, on the island
of Santa Domingo. She has steam up, awaiting orders.
She will be here in time, and all those who
have knowledge of the printing or shipment of the
other three hundred millions, will, on the completion
of their duties, go on board of her for a trip to Hayti,
and, on their return a fortnight afterwards, receive
the same gift of $1,000 each for his services.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your plan is ingenious, yet simple, Mr. Morning,
and seems likely to be effective. So far as this department
is concerned, its execution will involve a
departure from all rules and precedents, and I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>not escape hot criticism if I order it, especially from
the New York papers controlled by the conspirators.
But I see nothing really wrong or objectionable in it,
and ‘nice customs courtesy to great kings,’ and you
are a great king, Mr. Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say rather that the exigency is a great king,
Mr. Secretary. You will then aid me as I ask you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Mr. Secretary. In the future any
favor you may ask of me, personal or official, will
not be denied.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was blue Monday in Wall Street. It was the beginning
of the second week of the most disastrous
panic ever known in the history of finance. Capital
fled, affrighted, to its strong boxes, and refused to
come forth at any rate of interest, or upon any security.
Values had been going downward without reaction
for six days. The yellings and shoutings in
the stock board were such as might have been indulged
in by escapees from an asylum for violent lunatics.
Fortune after fortune had been swept into the
vortex in a vain attempt to stay the current. Stocks
which had ranked for years as among the most reliable
of investments, descended the grade as rapidly as
the “fancies.” Northwestern had fallen from $112 to
$60; Western Union from $80 to $45, and Lackawana
from $138 to $70, and even at these prices more stock
was apparently offered than found purchasers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conspirators were, apparently, successful.
Three men whose combined wealth already aggregated
$300,000,000, had produced this storm of disaster
merely to increase their millions, regardless of
ruined homes. They sold their own stock as they had
plotted, seventy-five millions of it at full rates, and seventy-five
millions at an average reduction of fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>per cent, early the preceding week, and before Morning
had perfected his arrangements, or appeared
upon the scene. Their subsequent short sales were
made at lower prices than they had estimated, for
others came in competition with them, as vendors.
They locked up both the currency received from their
sales, and the currency they had borrowed, so effectually
that merchants, brokers, and others, who were
unable to obtain the usual banking accommodations,
were compelled to throw upon the market their holdings
of bank, railroad, and telegraph stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolf, who personally led the bear raid in the board,
followed prices down with fresh lines of shorts, to an
amount beyond that originally intended, and at the
close of the previous week, the short sales of the conspirators
amounted to $400,000,000. In one particular
they had miscalculated, for, after stocks had fallen
twenty per cent, the brokers who purchased them refused
to loan them again for resale on the customary
margin, but believing, or affecting to believe, that
prices would advance with greater celerity than they
had receded, they demanded an amount of money as
margin equal to the difference between the existing
market price of the stock loaned and the market
price that ruled before the break.</p>

<p class='c007'>This demand was made under the direction of
Morning, who did not appear in public, but, from his
private office on Broadway, sent orders to a dozen different
brokers whose services had not been engaged
by the Gray-Claybank-Wolf syndicate. After the
first break, Morning was the purchaser of nine-tenths
of the stock sold, and after each purchase the money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>paid for the stock, with the margin added, was locked
up in the vaults of one of his brokers, or in banks
not under the control of the conspirators. In this
way the syndicate had been compelled to add $60,000,000
to the $140,000,000 they had received from
the sale of their own stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of the second Monday of November,
1895, the “Gold King” was the owner, by purchase,
of stocks which had cost him $400,000,000,
but which were worth, at the prices which prevailed
before the raid, $600,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>These stocks had been loaned to the conspirators
by Morning, repurchased by him, loaned and repurchased
again, until he now held in his control two hundred
millions of money, put up by the syndicate as
margin, or security, for the delivery to him of stocks
which needed only to be restored to their former
value to cause the conspirators to lose $200,000,000,
and Morning to gain that sum. If, however, prices
could be kept at panic figures until the conspirators
could turn buyers, and cover their shorts, they would
gain $200,000,000, which would be filched from whomsoever
had been compelled to sell.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were $400,000,000 at stake on the game.
The bear syndicate thought they were playing with
loaded dice, and so they were, but the load was against
them, instead of being in their favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday night a private conference was held at
Mr. Claybank’s residence, on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow,” said Gray, “let us stop selling and
begin buying, and cover as rapidly as possible. There
are some features of the situation which fill me with
uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Ont so I thinks, Misder Gray,” said Wolf. “I
don’t gomprehent where the money comes from on
Fritay and Saturtay with which our sales were met.
As I figure it, we hat every tollar locked up on Thurstay
that was anywhere available, but so much as a
huntret, or, maby, a huntret and fifty millions of new
money came into the street on yesterday and Fritay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It probably came from Chicago,” said Claybank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied Wolf. “Chicago sent only fifty
millions, ont it vas all here by Wednesday. It buzzles
me, ont I ton’t like it, ont I believe it is full time
to commence closing the deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, accordingly, agreed to close it, and on Monday
morning these three worthies appeared in their
seats in the Stock Exchange, for they were all members
of that body, although they seldom or never
participated in its proceedings, preferring to transact
their business through other brokers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning was also a member of the Stock Exchange,
having purchased a seat a year previously, but he
did not often appear there, and had never bought
or sold a share of stock himself in open board. Even
amid the excitement of the panic, his presence gave
interest to the occasion, for his sobriquet of the
“Gold King” attached legitimately to his ownership
of a mine that was yielding $4,000,000 per month,
with the probability of making its owner in a few
years the greatest billionaire in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were probably few among the active members
of the Stock Exchange who did not, at this time,
know nearly as much about the causes of the panic as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>even the three men who produced it, and among all
the brokers, except those in the employment of the
syndicate, only indignation was expressed at the operations
of Wolf, Claybank, and Gray. The New York
stockbroker is neither a Shylock nor a miser. He is
usually a genial, generous sort of fellow, who prefers
a bull market to a bear raid. He likes to make
money himself and have everybody else make it. A
boom is his delight, and a panic his abhorrence. If a
majority of the board of brokers could have had their
way, they would have hung the members of the syndicate
to the gallery railings, and the question of
reaching them in some lawful way, and relieving the
board from the effects of their conspiracy, had been
informally discussed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But nothing was attempted, because nothing seemed
really practicable. It was well known that the existing
condition of things had been produced by locking up
the currency. So long as it remained locked up,
prices must remain at whatever figures the conspirators
might choose to place them. Only the power that
withdrew the money from circulation, could restore
it to the channels of commerce. There was absolutely
nothing for those not already ruined to do except to
hide in the jungle until the three tigers should have
fully gorged themselves. When Claybank, Gray,
and Wolf should graciously permit the money to be
unlocked, then stocks would advance to their real
value, business would resume its proper channels, and
the panic would be over—and not until then.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Exchange, stocks were called alphabetically,
and the first upon the list of railroad securities was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe. This was not
a dividend-paying or favorite investment stock, and,
probably, three-fourths of it had been held in the street
for years, in speculative and marginal holdings. Morning
had special reasons for securing control of this road
in addition to his general purpose of thwarting the
conspirators. Prior to the panic, Atchison, Topeka,
and Santa Fe had vibrated for months between $27
and $33, and on the Saturday previous to the Monday
which saw the beginning of the bear raid, it had
closed at $30. Under the operations of the conspirators,
it had been hammered down to $15, at which
figure it closed on the previous Saturday.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the syndicate brokers who sat by Wolf,
opened the ball by offering two hundred shares of
Atchison at $15.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taken,” cried Morning, from his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five hundred Atchison at $15½,” said the broker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taken,” replied Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shade of uneasiness covered the features of the
broker, but, in response to a gesture from Wolf, he
called again:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“One thousand Atchison offered at $16.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taken,” said Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The broker dropped into his seat and mopped his
face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any further offers of Atchison for sale?” cried
the caller.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there was no reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two hundred Atchison, Brown to Morning, at
$15; five hundred Atchison, Brown to Morning, at
$15½; one thousand Atchison, Brown to Morning, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>$16. Are there further bids for Atchison?” said the
caller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolf arose and cried, “Fifteen dollars is offered for
one thousand Atchison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no higher offer, but the caller did not
proceed to cry the next stock on the list. Somehow
everybody seemed to feel that a crisis had been
reached; it was in the air, and, amidst a hushed and
expectant silence unprecedented in the history of the
New York Stock and Exchange Board, the voice of
David Morning rang out like a trumpet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will give,” said he, “$30 per share for the whole
or any portion of the capital stock of the Atchison,
Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad Company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then pandemonium reigned. The quick wit of the
stockbrokers comprehended the situation in an instant.
It was all as clear to them as if it had been written
and printed. They knew that Claybank, Wolf, and
Gray had joined forces, locked up the currency,
brought about a panic, broken down the market, and
ruined half the street. They knew that the country
was prosperous, the mines prolific, and the crops good.
They knew that the depression in prices was wholly
artificial, and that it must, sooner or later, be followed
by a reaction and restoration of values, and they had
so advised their customers, but they supposed that the
period of such reaction was wholly within the control
of Gray, Claybank, and Wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had no reason to expect that relief would
come from any other source, and the appearance and
action of Morning burst upon them like a revelation.
Here was a man who was a new-comer to fortune and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>to finance, a man who had devoted the immense
revenues of his mine to beneficent rather than business
purposes, and who was above the necessity or
the temptation of increasing his wealth by speculation.
His presence in the Board, and his bid of $30 a share
for Atchison, demonstrated that he knew of the Claybank-Gray-Wolf
conspiracy, and that he proposed
to baffle it. He must have measured the forces of the
members of the syndicate and be advised as to the
amount of money necessary to meet them. Possibly
he had found a way to unlock the federal treasury, or
had from some source obtained the necessary millions.
Certainly he had obtained them or he would never
have thus challenged the magnates of Wall Street to
combat. Clearly, the panic was at an end, the man
from Arizona was about to lead them out of the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>And they shouted, and roared, and cried, and
hugged each other, and mashed each others’ hats, and
marched up and down and around the floor, and
joined hands and danced around Morning, and disregarded
all calls to order, and were finally quieted only
when Morning, escorted by the President of the Stock
Exchange, ascended the stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The President, as soon as silence was secured,
said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen, it seems to be the general wish that
the regular call shall be temporarily suspended, and
that we shall hear from Mr. David Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That gentleman, after the roar of greeting had subsided,
said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: I think you will agree with me in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>believing that the prices of securities listed on this
exchange have, during the past week, ruled altogether
too low. I propose to put an end to this condition of
things, which ought never to have been brought about,
and I have authorized my brokers here to offer, during
to-day and to-morrow, and for the rest of this week,
to purchase, to the extent of $700,000,000, any and
all railroad stocks listed on this Exchange, at the
prices which ruled at the close of the board on Saturday
week, before the panic began.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A great cheer went up from the throats of the
multitude, and, after it subsided, Isaiah Wolf, livid
with rage and excitement, arose and exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does this lunatic then expect to make fools of us
all? Is it to be beliefed dot this crazy man has got
seven huntret millions of tollars in cash to buy stocks
mit? His golt mine has turned his prain. It vos
better dot we don’t all pe too fresh apout this pizness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning quietly continued:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anticipating that my purchases of stock might
possibly be large to-day and during the week, I have
made arrangements to dispense with the customary
methods, and so will avoid the usual delays in receiving
and paying for stock. I have quadrupled my
usual force of clerks, and my offices on Broadway will
be open every day this week from nine o’clock in the
morning until nine o’clock at night. No checks,
certified or otherwise, will be issued by me, but the
stocks bought by my brokers will be paid for on
delivery at my offices at any time during the hours
named, and paid for in treasury and national bank
notes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Where,” roared Wolf, “did you get such a sum
of money as seven huntret millions of tollars? You
are either a liar, a lunatic, or a counterfeiter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two hundred millions of dollars of the money
which I hold,” replied Morning, “was deposited by
you and your colleagues in the conspiracy, as security
for the return of stocks which I bought of you, and
then loaned to you to sell to me again and again.
Under the rules of the stock board these $200,000,000
will be forfeited to me unless you restore the borrowed
stocks on the usual notice. The notices will be served
on you to-day, and when you begin to buy in to cover
your shorts, you will be compelled to pay full value.
I think I can count upon your $200,000,000 to aid in
paying for to-day’s purchases, Mr. Wolf.” And, amid
continued cheers and laughter, Morning descended
from the caller’s stand, and started for his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Claybank and Gray had left the hall, but Wolf
remained, and as Morning passed along the aisle, the
Jew, with face white and twitching, and with foam on
his mustache, stepped out and confronted him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have made a beggar of me,” said he with a
curse, “but I will have your heart’s blood for this,”
and he reached for Morning’s throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the man from Arizona stepped backward and
then forward, and at the same moment his right arm
went swiftly forth from his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Smack! smack! smack!” and the nose of Wolf
was spread over his face, and the crazed man was
hustled and hurried by the crowd, and greeted with
oaths and blows as he went, until, with torn clothing
and battered face, he was literally kicked into the
street.</p>

<p class='c007'>We copy from our advertising column the foregoing,
which presages the most important event of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>century. Whatever may be thought of the wisdom
of Mr. Morning’s plans in any direction, there can now
be no question as to his ability to carry them forward.
The brilliant strategetical movement by which
he bagged two hundred millions of piratical money
from Gray, Claybank, and Wolf, and, while defeating
them, restored values and prosperity, is still fresh in
the public mind, and his subsequent course in searching
out all other persons who lost by the panic, and
reimbursing them the amount of their losses, will not
soon be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brave and sagacious action of the Secretary of
the Treasury in going outside of the channels marked
by red tape in order to promote Mr. Morning’s plans,
is generally commended by the public, and meets
with no criticism except from the baffled syndicate of
scoundrels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever action, if any, Congress may take next
month when it assembles with regard to the demonetization
of gold, and whatever may be the course pursued
by the German Reichstag, the French Chamber
of Deputies, and the British Parliament, all of which
are now wrestling with the great economic problem
which the vast gold yield of the Morning mine presents,
yet one thing is certain, David Morning has
quietly and shrewdly placed two thousand five hundred
millions of gold in the mints and treasuries of
Europe and America, and obtained therefor money,
the legal tender quality and value of which, no future
legislation can impair.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is fortunate for the world that this vast sum is in
the hands of a man who seems to comprehend the nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of the problems which its existence, its introduction
to circulation, and its subsequent use, will create,
and who also seems disposed to treat his great treasure-trove
as a public trust rather than a personal possession.
It is a curious fact that some statesmen who have,
without much reflection, been characterized as visionary,
urged vainly for years upon the public attention
the wisdom and feasibility of creating vast sums of
fiat money, which were to be loaned upon land and
crop values. It will not escape notice that the Congress
of the United States might, at any time within
the past few years, by passing a land and property
loan law, have created the same conditions, whether
they prove to be conditions of prosperity or disaster,
which are now upon the world by reason of Mr.
Morning’s gold discovery. But it is not our purpose
to attempt discussion of the situation generally. We
intend only to give to the public a reliable account of
the railroad projects of Mr. Morning. On reading
his advertisement, we dispatched a reporter, who found
him, as usual, frank and communicative. No comment
of ours would add force or importance to the
utterances of the Arizona Gold King, and we will let
him tell his story in his own way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My plan,” said Morning, “is not complicated,
and not original with me. I only supply the means
to try an experiment which it has often been suggested
should be tried by the United States Government.
If successful it will be of incalculable benefit to the
people of this country. It will require not more than
$250,000,000 to carry it out, and its failure would not
involve a loss of more than $50,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“I marvel,” continued the gentleman, “that public
opinion did not years ago act upon Congress so as
to cause it to deal with the transportation question in
the interest of the people. I marvel that some of our
great capitalists have not joined efforts, and devoted
a portion of their possessions to providing the people
with cheap transportation. Suppose that a dozen of
them should have together made a pool of $200,000,000,
and undertaken a work—not of charity, but of
helping the toilers to help themselves. It would not
have taken one-third of their possessions; it would
have deprived neither them nor their children of a
single luxury, and yet it would have allayed the disquiet
and antagonism of multitudes, and, more than
bronzes or marble shafts, it would have linked their
names to immortality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not Messrs. Gray, Claybank, and Wolf have
supplied the funds for your experiment?” queried
the reporter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning laughed as he answered: “Well, in a way,
yes; and if I had not already devoted their contributions
to founding and maintaining industrial schools,
there would be a sort of poetical justice in making
such application of that fund.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you give me, for the <cite>Times</cite>, the details of
your plans, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” replied that gentlemen. “I have
nothing to conceal. The railroad lines of this country,
especially the transcontinental lines, were built when
material and labor were much higher than now, and
some of them when gold was at a high premium.
Stock and bonds of many roads have been watered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and in paying present market prices for them I shall
probably pay much more than the sum for which the
roads could be duplicated if constructed honestly and
economically at present cost of labor and materials,
and allowing nothing for subsidies, bounties, stealings,
and profits of speculators, contractors, and legislators.
But it would not, I think, be right to punish
present holders of stocks and bonds for the sins of
their predecessors in interest, and I therefore propose
to pay the present inflated value of these securities.
I shall not, however, attempt to make the reorganized
road carry the burden of paying interest and
dividends upon the sums which I shall pay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you estimate to be the present market
value of the roads you propose to purchase, Mr.
Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At present market rates, and I shall pay no more,
the total amount that will be required to buy in both
stocks and bonds, will be, in round numbers, $150,000,000.
I am advised by experts that the cost of
widening roadbed and bridges, and laying additional
iron, so as to make four tracks from New York to
Kansas City, and a double track from the Missouri
River to the Pacific, will, with the necessary buildings
and shops, be about $70,000,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the proposed line, when completed, will
have cost you about $220,000,000?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly, less the sum which may be received
for rolling stock, which I propose to sell. But I am
informed by my engineers that a similar line might
be built now for $150,000,000, and I therefore take
$150,000,000 as the actual value of the roadbed, station
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>buildings, and shops for repairs, and I estimate
traffic charges upon that basis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you sell the rolling stock? How can
a road be used without locomotives or cars?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I propose that the company I will cause to be
organized shall, except in certain contingencies, run
no trains whatever on the road except repair trains.
The roadbed will be open at uniform tolls to any
person, firm, or corporation who may wish to run
trains upon it. The tolls will be fixed upon such a
basis as will provide means sufficient to keep the roadbed
up to the highest standard, and pay five per cent
per annum upon the actual value of the road, which,
in the first instance, will be fixed at $150,000,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not the value of the road advance, Mr.
Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I expect so,” was the reply. “All values will advance
with the increase of standard money, caused by
the yield of the Morning mine, and there will be a revaluation
of the roadbed each year, by disinterested
and competent engineers. If the amount received for
tolls in any one year shall exceed the sum of five per
cent on the valuation of the previous year, the tolls
will be reduced for the next year. If it shall fall short
of that sum, the tolls will be increased for the next
year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not the ownership of the roadbed by one
company, and the ownership and management of
rolling stock by a dozen or a hundred other companies,
be productive of confusion and accidents?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all. On the contrary, accidents will be almost
impossible. Switches and side tracks, capable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of accommodating from one to a dozen trains or
more, will be provided every five miles, with buildings
for receiving freight and passengers, at every
station. Between Boston and Kansas City two tracks
will be devoted to passenger trains and two to freight
trains, and a uniform rate of speed be established,
of thirty-five miles per hour, including stoppages on
the main track, for passenger trains, and fifteen miles
an hour for freight trains. Between Kansas City and
San Francisco, so long as there shall be only one
double track, on which both freight and passenger
trains must run, a uniform rate of speed of twenty
miles an hour for both freight and passenger trains
will be established, except on mountain grades, where
the speed must be lessened. There will be an interval
of not less than fifteen minutes between trains east
of the Missouri, and half an hour west of it, and whenever
a train leaves or passes by a station, its passage
over the rails at that station will, through an electric
wire, be made to ring a bell, set a signal, and close a
switch at the next station behind it, and no train will
be allowed to leave or pass by a station until a signal
shall be received that the preceding train has passed
by the station ahead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose a train conductor or engineer should
proceed without receiving the signal, and in defiance
of orders from the station master?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“His train would be automatically shunted off
upon a side track, where it would run up against
elastic buffers of rubber, filled with air. The main
track would not be clear until the train passed the
station ahead. Until then the switch leading to the
side track would be open.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“And how would that switch be again opened,
after being closed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Automatically, by the passage of the train over
the rails ahead of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a very ingenious and original idea, Mr.
Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ingenious and simple, but it is not my own. A
similar contrivance was in use on the Italian roads
twenty years ago, although the idea was suggested to
me by an Arizona rancher, who was averse to having
cattle straying in his alfalfa fields, through which several
public roads ran. In order to avoid the cost of
fencing the roads, he put up automatic gates. The
weight of the horses and vehicle upon a platform a
few yards from the gate, on either side, operated upon
a lever, and swung open the gate, which was released
automatically by the passage of the wagon, and so
swung shut.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem, by these arrangements, to have secured
the safety of passengers and train hands, but
how about the speed? Will the traveling public be
content with twenty miles an hour between Kansas
City and San Francisco?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know. If they shall not be, still the
speed would be satisfactory to the freighters. My
own belief is that the greater safety and lower rates
of passage that will prevail on this road will attract
to it a large share of the passenger traffic. Those
who are in haste can travel over one of the other
lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your object seems to be to give to the public
cheaper railroad service.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“It is partly that and partly to give the railroad
employes better pay and greater regularity and permanency
of employment. I will try to divide the
benefits equitably.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not those who run trains upon your road
defeat your object by combinations among themselves,
to put up the price of freight and passage, and put
down the wages of railroad hands?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be practicable, I think, to guard against
both these things. If the Brotherhoods of Locomotive
Firemen, and Locomotive Engineers, and Train
Hands, will establish and maintain reasonable rates of
compensation and hours of labor, and will enable all
qualified workers to become members at will, then the
directors of the company owning the roadbed will
only allow its use to trains managed by Brotherhood
members. If persons or companies owning rolling
stock shall advance freight or passenger rates beyond
maximum, or reduce them below minimum, rates, fixed
by the directors of the Railway Company, they will
lose their right to run trains, and if a combination
should be made to diminish facilities to shippers or
travelers, then the Roadbed Company will itself place
a freight and passenger service on the track.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you expect to personally superintend this
great work, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I must leave it to others. Once it shall be
well started I have other projects which will require
my attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who will run it, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Board of Directors will, in the first instance,
consist of the governor of each State through which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the roadbed shall be constructed, from Maine to California.
To these fifteen or sixteen governors will be
added thirty experienced railway managers, who will
be selected by me. Each governor will serve as
director only during his term as governor, and will be
succeeded as director by his official successor as
governor. The thirty directors appointed by me will
receive liberal salaries, will not be permitted to be
interested in any other railroad, and will serve until
they resign, or die, or are removed for cause by a two-thirds
vote of the other directors. Vacancies thus
occurring will be filled by a similar vote. Subject to
the principles of management I have endeavored to
outline, the control of the affairs of the company will
be with the Board of Directors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not the vast sums of money which the yield of
the Morning mine must add to the standard currency
of the world so inflate values as to make difficult any
equitable adjustment of freight or passenger rates, or
of the wages of railroad workers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Freight and passenger rates, and wages, will
necessarily advance with the increase of all values.
It will be like the tide at the Dardanelles, which never
ebbs. No man who has any knowledge, or exercises
any care, need be overwhelmed or hurt by it, and all
men who try can guide their barks to prosperity upon
its swell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you consider it really a healthful state of
affairs if, by an inflated currency, prices were so
increased that a dinner which one can now buy for
fifty cents should cost $5.00, and a $20 coat sell for
$200?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Why not if prices were similarly advanced over
all the world? People indulge in a good deal of loose
talk about inflated currency, debased currency, and
fiat money. In truth, all money is fiat money, for a
bar of gold is not a legal tender, and inflation of
values is the law of commercial growth. In the middle
ages a penny was the price of a day’s wages or
of a bushel of wheat. Money which has for its basis
either precious metals or substantial property in lands
or merchandise is good money, while money lacking
such basis is bad money. Clipped shillings, French
assignats, and Continental and Confederate currency,
were no more fiat money than are American double
eagles or five-pound Bank of England notes. It is
the stamp of the government, the fiat of its power,
that turns the metal or the paper into money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But do not all financiers consider inflation a
disaster, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Inflation,” replied the gentleman, “whether of
metallic or paper currency that is accepted by the
world or by a great commercial nation as a legal tender,
can do no harm except to those who loan money. A
dollar is a mere term. You pay now five dimes, or
fifty cents, or five hundred mills, for your dinner.
Suppose by large continued increase in the production
of gold and silver, the money of all countries shall
be inflated so that you must pay fifty dollars instead
of fifty cents, or five hundred dimes in place of five
hundred mills, for your dinner. What of it? You
could carry as much paper money as now. It would
need only to increase the denomination of the bills.
All property and services would advance proportionately.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Only the loaners of money would be left, and
they would soon find it to their interest to put their
money into property, which would necessarily advance
in value, rather than in loans, which would, in their
relation to property, necessarily decrease in value.
Under such conditions interest would not compensate
the money owner for the depreciation of his principal,
and the loaning of money, except for brief periods,
would cease, while property of all kinds would always
be saleable for cash, because always sure to increase
in value, while idle money would not so increase.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will be the effect of your project on the
other railroads, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My hope and expectation is that the successful
working of my project will induce large aggregations
of capital to acquire and conduct all the railroads in
the country under one management, which should
itself be under the direction and control of the Federal
Government. Four thousand millions of dollars
would purchase and free from bonded indebtedness
all the interstate railroad and telegraph lines in the
United States, and $1,000,000,000 more would improve
such property to the highest point of efficiency. A
company with a capital of $5,000,000,000, having no
bonded debt and economically and honestly managed,
could pay dividends of five per cent per annum on
its stock, which stock might be increased in amount
as other values increased. Present railroad bondholders
would be transformed into railroad stockholders,
and the stock of the United States Consolidated
Railroad Company, guaranteed by the United States
Government to pay five per cent per annum, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>conducted as to earn that dividend, above cost of repairs
and construction of new lines, would be a favorite
investment. Such stock might be made the basis of
currency issued thereon to national banks. It could
be held by benevolent and educational institutions,
and trust funds could be invested in it. It would take
the place of the present United States bonds as a lazy
fund, and it would not be a lazy fund, for it would be
an investment in earning property. It would substitute
the earned increment of labor for the unearned
increment of interest. Interest on money at best
belongs to conditions which are passing away. It
is an attribute of a former civilization, and I predict
that during the next century it will come to an end
altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How would the United States Consolidated Railroad
Company affect railway patrons and railroad
employes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By adjusting freight and passenger charges, and
wages of employes, so as to produce an income of
five per cent on the investment, and by discontinuing
non-paying lines, building new ones, and developing
profitable connections—in brief, by running all the
railroads in the land as one company under one management,
in such manner as to produce from earnings
a net income of five per cent, on a capitalization of
all existing stocks and bonds at their market value
to-day—the prices of freight and passage would be
reduced, and the wages of railroad workers increased.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” continued the Arizona Gold King,
“that the entire system should be under government
supervision, or even under government direction, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>depend upon it, nobody would be harmed, except
about forty thousand people, who now own sixty per
cent of all the real property in America, and even the
damage to them would be slight, for they could purchase
stock in the Consolidated Company, and learn
to be satisfied with five per cent and no stealings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You spoke of a provision being made in your
company for the future of railroad employes. How
would that be done?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the company which I propose each employe
will be required to agree that not less than fifteen per
cent of his wages shall be withheld from him and annually
invested in the stock of the company, which
stock shall be non-transferable. It will be delivered
with its dividends, likewise invested, at his death to
whomsoever he may designate, or, if he live to the age
of sixty, it will be paid to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think that the worker needs this sort of
compulsory guardianship, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly do. For one of them who lays up for
a rainy day, nine are possessed by the very genius of
unthrift. I have known miners to work for months,
and mining is the hardest work in the world, and then
draw their wages and expend hundreds of dollars in
one spree. Where the worker uses liquor—as most
of them do—he lives from hand to mouth, and even
among the temperate, it will be the rare exception to
find one who has enough savings to support his family
for six months.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it only the workers who are imprudent, Mr.
Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, the habit of careless unthrift is common to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>men. It is not confined to the worker. It appears
more frequently in him only because his necessities
are more urgent and apparent, and, in this respect,
he lives more in public. But extravagance is a part
of the original savage man, the leaven which has survived
all civilization. I have known lawyers, and
doctors, and divines, and journalists who, with their
families, might have been saved from embarrassment
and suffering if there had been some power every
month to seize a portion of their earnings or income
and make a compulsory investment of it for their future
benefit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” said the speaker, “to return to my subject.
There is yet another advantage to be considered. If
the United States operated, or even supervised, all the
railroads, it would not be difficult—by requiring each
railroad hand to report for drill and practice one day
in each month—it would not be difficult to provide
the nucleus and material for a great army, if such
should ever again be necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will the time ever come when armies can be dispensed
with, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it has come. I am about to have made
some experiments with the new explosive ‘potentite,’
which, if successful, will, I think, demonstrate to the
world that hereafter war will mean simply mutual annihilation,
and that in conflict there will be small odds
between the weakest and the most powerful of nations.
But I wander into the domain of speculation, and you
newspaper men require only facts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you propose any reform or changes in the
present methods of railroad management, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“Several.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be a uniform rate per mile for passage,
all tickets will be transferable, no inducements will be
offered to travelers to perpetrate falsehood and forgery,
and freighters will not be required to expose their
business secrets to the officers of the railroad company.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know,” said Mr. Morning, “that a demand
has actually been made upon me by the railroad
companies for freight at regular express gold
bullion rates on $2,500,000,000 worth of gold bars
which they carried from Arizona to the East disguised
as copper? For freight on the supposed copper I
paid their regular rates of charges, amounting to
about $200,000. They say that if I had shipped it as
gold their charges would have been six and one-quarter
millions, and they claim the difference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you shipped it as copper at your own risk,
did you not, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I shipped it as copper at my own risk,
and on ten bars, worth really $400,000, which were
lost from the ferryboat in transporting freight during
the flood at Yuma, I collected from the company
only their supposed copper value of $320, and I had
no end of trouble and delay in making the collection.
But they assert that in covering the gold bars with
copper sheaths, I worked a ‘gold brick swindle’ on
them, and they want the difference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you pay the $6,000,000 claimed, Mr. Morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I can help it,” smiled the gentleman. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>have other uses for the money. I have in view several
other reforms in railroad management. Railroad
employers who, through no fault of their own, are
hurt in railroad accidents caused by the negligence of
a fellow employe, shall have the same right of recovery
at law against the company as an injured passenger
would have. Train men, in stopping at country
stations, shall consult the convenience of passengers
rather than their own, and shall not halt the baggage
car in a sheltered spot, while they compel disembarking
passengers to wade through the mud. Brass-mounted
conductors shall not glower at question-asking
passengers, and, to all requests for information,
answer flippantly, ‘Damfino,’ and small dogs shall not
be torn from their friends and suffered to wail their
strength away in mute despair in a strange and comfortless
baggage car, without bones to beguile or
friendly faces to encourage them; but every reputable
lapdog who pays his fare, and abides noiseless and
contented in the same seat with his mistress, shall be
left in peace.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='small'>“Their country’s wealth, our mightier misers drain.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a bright, warm day in December, 1895,
when a tall man, with iron gray hair surmounting a
wrinkled and careworn face, paused for a moment
before the plate-glass front of the Tenth National
Bank of Birmingham, Alabama.</p>

<p class='c007'>Making his way into the building, he walked to the
cashier’s office in the rear, which he entered without
knocking. A short, stout gentleman of forty years
looked up from the desk at which he was writing, and
inquired of the stranger who it was that he wished to
see?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I kem in, suh, to see the Kashyea,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am the cashier of this bank, sir. What can I
do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I allowed to bowwow some money foh to
stock my fahm foh a cotton crap, and to cahy me
ovah the season, suh, and I heard as how the money
might be had heah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take a seat, sir. What is the name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Turpin is my name, suh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what amount do you wish to obtain, Mr.
Turpin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon about $3,000 would answer the puppus,
suh.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Where is your property, Mr. Turpin, and what
does it consist of?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is on the White Creek, in Madison County.
There are foh hundred acres of cotton land. There
is a house, bahn, and outbuildings in faih condition,
suh, but I don’t count them as much, in a money
way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you estimate to be the value of the
land?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Befo the wah it sold for fohty dollahs an acre.
Land went very low aftahwuds, but the land has not
been crapped, and of late yeahs, business has picked
up mightily in old Alabama, and it ought to be wuth
as much now as it ever wor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long have you been farming it there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, not at all, suh. The place was owned by
my uncle, and he jest lived there since the wah, and
never tried to make a crap. He was Captain of Company
K of the Ninety-third Alabama. He was
wounded at Chickamauga. Both of his sons were
killed at the second battle of the Wilderness; his wife
died while they were all away, and when he kem back
he seemed to lose all interest like. He couldn’t abide
free niggahs ever, and there were no othahs, and foh
twenty-seven yeahs he jest moped around the old
place, raisin’ only a little cohn, and a few hogs and
some geyahden truck. Last spring he died, and the
place has fallen to me. There is no debt on it, and
it’s prime cotton land, but it will take right smaht
of money to clean off the land and put in a crap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you farming elsewhere, Mr. Turpin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, suh, I have been wuking for several yeahs for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, as
their station agent at Coosa, but I was raised on a cotton
plantation, and I know all about the wuk. I
have two likely boys; one is twenty and the othah
eighteen. My wife is a wohkah, and so is our daughtah.
We all want to go on the old plantation and
live thar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will $3,000 clear the land and stock it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, suh. It will buy us mules and fahm implements,
and seed, and supply us with provisions and
foddah, and pay the wages of such niggahs as we will
hiah to help us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How soon could you repay the $3,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, in the old times we could moh than pay it
with one crap, but thar ain’t the money in cotton that
thar used to be. Cotton is powerful low, I do allow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it costs more to raise it now than it did when
you had slaves to work for you, does it not, Mr. Turpin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I allow that don’t make much diffahence,
suh. I can hiah niggahs now for $16 a month, and
they find their own keep, while befoh the wah we had
to pay that much and moah, and feed them beside.
The interest on the value of a good niggah then was
nigh onto as much as we pay him now foh wages.
The niggah don’t get much moah now than he did
when he was in slavery. He just gets his keep and a
few clothes: No, suh, I can raise cotton now cheaper
than I could befoh the wah, but cotton kain’t be sold
foh no such prices. Still, thar is some money in cotton,
and my boys and I can pay off the $3,000 with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>interest, out of the profits on the craps, in three
yeahs, and if we live powerful close mebbe we can do
it in two yeahs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you not get the money you want from
the bank at Huntsville?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, suh, I went thar before I kem yeah, and the
kashyea thar tole me that they wah not fixed to make
any but shote loans. He said as how they wah a
nayshunal bank, and couldn’t loan money on land
nohow, and he advised me to come heah, suh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this is also a national bank, and subject to
the same restriction, Mr. Turpin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, suh, I know; so he tole me, suh. But he
said as how you wah also loan agents for Northern
capitalists, who had money to invest in long loans, on
good security.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are such agents, but our instructions do not
permit us to loan on anything but improved city
property. Our clients do not like to put their money
in plantations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, suh, what will become of the cities if the people
do not help those in the country? My place is
wuth easily foh times the money I want to bowwow,
and every dollah of the money bowwowed will go
into the place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does look, Mr. Turpin, as if money ought to
be had for such purposes. But all of our local capitalists
have their money tied up in the city, and outsiders
won’t loan on farms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I kain’t bowwow the money, suh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid not, Mr. Turpin. You might try elsewhere,
but, to be candid with you, I do not believe
you will succeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Well, suh, then I will have to go back to my wuk
at the railroad station, and let the land lie idle. Why
kain’t the govuhment loan us on our fahms the money
needed to cultivate them? ’Pears like I hearn tell
thar was a man out in Calafohnea what wanted the
govuhment to do that likes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied the cashier, “there is such a scheme,
but it is totally impracticable. Of course the government
cannot embark in the business of loaning money
on landed security.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But ain’t the govuhment in the loanin’ business
now, suh? Whar do you get the circulatin’ notes of
youah bank? Don’t you bowwow them of the govuhment,
without interest, by puttin’ up United States
bonds as security?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that, you know, is quite a different thing,”
answered the cashier, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whar’s the difference in principle?” persisted the
man from Coosa. “If a govuhment bond foh $1,000
air good secuhity foh $900, what is the reason that a
piece of land wuth $1,000 kain’t be good secuhity foh
$500?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bond,” said the cashier, “could always be
sold at par. It is not so easy to find a purchaser for
land, even at half its value; it might be worthless, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not supposin’, suh, that the govuhment
would loan money on wuthless land any moah than
on counterfeit bonds. I’m talkin’ about sich land as
ain’t wuthless, and kain’t evah be wuthless. I’m talkin’
about land that has an airnin’ capacity, when human
labor is applied to it. I allow that sich land, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>valooed honestly, and not countin’ any buildings or
improvements, or anything that can be burned up or
carried away—I allow that sich land is just as good
security foh a loan of half its value, as any govuhment
bond is security foh a loan of nine-tenths its
valoo. If the land ain’t wuth nothin’, I’d like to know
what the bond is wuth? As I argefy, all the valoo’s
on the yearth, suh, bonds and banks and govuhments
theyselves rest upon the land and the labah that tills
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the amount of national bank notes that can be
issued on government bonds is limited by law,” remonstrated
the cashier.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose they be. Kain’t the govuhment limit the
amount of greenbacks it would loan on the fahms?
Kain’t it allot jest so much to each State or to each county,
or to each numbah of folks? I don’t see no use of a
limit nohow. Govuhment don’t limit the bales of cotton
or bushels of cohn, or numbah of hogs a man can
raise, noh the tons of ihon he shall smelt, noh the
numbah of days’ wuk he shall do in a yeah. What
foh do they want to limit the numbah of dollahs that
shall be made? Why not leave that to be settled outside
of papah laws? If you raise cohn for which there
is no demand you kain’t sell it, and if you print dollahs
for which there is no demand you kain’t lend
them. A dollah ain’t got no nateral valoo nohow.
Ye kain’t eat it, noh drink it, noh weah it. Ye kain’t
sleep on it, noh ride it, noh drive it around. A dollah
is just a yahdstick foh the cloth, a scale foh the
sugah, a quart measure foh the vinegah. Suppose
govuhment went to limitin’ the numbah of weighin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>scales and yahdsticks and gallon cans thar should be
in the land, and then didn’t allow enough to be made
foh to go around!—A nice fix the country stohs would
be in wouldn’t they? You city folks would corral all
the yahdsticks, and all the scales, and all the pint
pots that the govuhment allowed to be made. You’d
organize measurin’ companies and bowwow all the
scales that the govuhment made, and pay nothin’ to
the govuhment for the use of them; and then you’d
hiah them out to folks at a big rent, and make the
folks as hiad them leave half the measures on deposit
with you, and you’d hiah that half again to other
folks, and you’d squeeze the people, and squeeze ’em,
and squeeze ’em, until you turned every man who
wasn’t an ownah of measurin’ tools into a puffeck
slave to them as was ownahs. That’s what you hev
been a doin’ with us right along. I mean no disrespeck
to you, suh, puhsonally, for you have treated
me moh politely than a bankah usually treats his bowwowin’
customahs; but you bankahs and capitalists
have jest been a monkeyin’ with the currency until
you have got every fahmah, and wukin’ man, and
stoahkeepah in the country tied hand and foot, with
no chance to wuk at all unless they wuk foh you. We
have been a lot of everlastin’ fools, suh, to stand it,
and we aint a goin’ to stand it much longah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will you do about it, Mr. Turpin?” said the
cashier, quietly, but with a shade of satire in his tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I allow, suh, that we’ll tell the yawpers who run
political conventions to get along without our votes,
and we’ll elect men to the Legislatoor and to Congress,
and mebbe a President, who’ll take their ideahs from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the fahmas and wukahs of the Sooth and West, and
who won’t go to Wall Street foh ohdahs; and we’ll
give all the old questions a rest, and we’ll make it lonesome
for the politicians who fight us, and we’ll kind o’
resolute that so long as this govuhment won’t let any
State or any puhson go into the business of manufacturing
money to supply the necessary wants of the people,
it is likely that the govuhment itself ought to do
it, and we’ll fix it so that no man who is willin’ to
wuk as I am, and knows how to wuk as I do, and has
land to plow as I have, will have to see his land lie
fallow, and his boys loafin’ around, just bekase he
kaint bowwow from nobody, even at ten per cent a
yeah, one-fifth of the valoo of his land, to buy a few
mules, and a plow or two, and some seed cohn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will compel the government to go into the
business of printing and loaning all the money that
anybody wants, will you?” said the cashier.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, suh, I’m no bankah, and no lawyah, but I
take it that it is the business of govuhment to provide
all the money necessary foh the use of the people, and
if the govuhment itself won’t do it, then let it untie
the cohds it has put around States and people, and
suffah them to do it foh theyselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would go back to the days of State banks
and unlimited currency, Mr. Turpin, with a wild-cat
bank at every crossroads, when the man who traveled
never knew whether the bank bill he got in change,
when purchasing his breakfast in Alabama, would buy
him a supper in Tennessee,” said the cashier.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, suh, I remembah those days, and while they
may not have been so agreeable foh those that traveled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>they war a heap better foh folks as stayed at
home. A wild-cat bank at the crossroads on White
Creek, that would let me have $3,000 of its missuble
money, which my neighbors would take in exchange
foh mules, and the stohkeepah would take for goods,
so that I could put in a crap on foh hundred akahs of
the puttiest cotton land in Noth Alabama, would be a
heap bettah foh me just now, suh, than a national
bank with a plate-glass front, in Buhmingham, that
won’t even look at the security I offah foh a loan.
Good-day, suh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mr. John Turpin, of White Creek, arose, and,
with a heavy and sorrowful step, walked out of the
Tenth National Bank of Birmingham, Alabama, and
the rotund cashier smiled at the episode, and adjusted
his gold-rimmed eyeglasses, and resumed his interrupted
labors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet relief was in store for Mr. John Turpin, for on
that very day the mail from New York to Washington
carried the following communication:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>Offices of David Morning</span>,     }</div>
      <div class='line'>39 Broadway, N. Y., Dec. 15, 1895.}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>To the President of the United States</em>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: Under certain conditions I will donate to the
Government of the United States the sum of $2,400,000,000
in gold bars, which I will deliver to the
treasury department at the rate of $100,000,000 per
month, during the ensuing two years.</p>

<p class='c011'>The money coined from, or issued upon, these gold
bars, shall constitute a perpetual fund, to be loaned
at two per cent per annum to the farmers of the country,
the fund never to be diminished or appropriated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>for any other purpose, although the interest received
from it may be used to aid in defraying the ordinary
expenses of government.</p>

<p class='c011'>The amounts to be loaned may be apportioned
among the several States and Territories, according
to their populations as given by the last census, but
the loaning must proceed from, and be under the
control of a department of the Federal government,
to be created by Congress for that purpose. Loans
may be made payable at any time, at the option of the
borrower, and may remain indefinitely, so long as the
interest is paid, and must be secured by pledge of productive
land.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not more than one-half the actual cash value of
the land, without estimating improvements, must be
loaned, or more than $10,000 to any one borrower, or
more than $20 per acre in any case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The celerity with which Congress, during the War
of the Rebellion, created an effective system of revenue
and finance, leads me to the conclusion that it
will be equally apt in the creation of the necessary
legal machinery to speedily effectuate a permanent
and safe system for making loans to the people. I
shall trust implicitly to the wisdom and patriotism of
Congress to carry out details if my gift is accepted,
as I think I may assume it will be, and I shall attempt
no interference with its action, even by suggestion,
beyond stating the conditions upon which the fund of
$2,400,000,000 will be provided.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will, possibly, not be out of place for me to assign
here a few of the reasons why I require that loans be
limited to the owners of productive land, and why I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>do not permit dwellers in towns and cities, and those
engaged in commerce and manufactures, to share in
the opportunity for procuring cheap money.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this very natural inquiry I might answer that I
have already arranged in San Francisco, in Chicago,
and in New York, for aiding co-operative labor corporations
to procure, at a low rate of interest, the
money necessary for their use; that I design extending
similar aid in other localities, and that I hear of
several instances of other gentlemen conveying large
sums in trust for such purposes.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the duty of aiding the farmers to cheap money
is so great, and so pressing, and extends to so many
persons, and over so large an area, that any concerted
effort in such direction is not only beyond the capacity
of individual wealth owners, but requires the machinery
and power of government for its adequate
discharge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The farmers, of all men, most need the aid of capital,
and of all men they find it most difficult to secure
such aid. For years before the accidental, or,
rather, providential, discovery of an immense deposit
of gold-bearing quartz in the Santa Catalina Mountains
in Arizona enabled me to attempt alleviation of some
of the evils under which the world suffers, I had
observed that even when the manufacturing and commercial
interests of the land were in a fairly prosperous
condition, the farmers did not share in the general
bounty, and I observed that usually the produce
of the farmers’ land could only be sold at such low
prices as left them, at the close of the season, a little
more in debt, and much more discouraged.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>The official report of the Illinois State Board of
Agriculture for 1889 exhibited the distressing fact
that the corn crop of that State for that year actually
sold for $10,000,000 less than it cost to produce it,
and conditions since then have only slightly improved.
Even as I write, there are thousands of families all
over the land, not merely in a few localities where the
crops have failed, but on the virgin prairies of Dakota,
on the rich soil of the Mississippi bottoms, and in the
fertile valleys of Virginia, who are in distress, not because
they have been idle or dissolute, but because
their last crops did not sell for enough to pay the cost
of their production and transportation to market, including
interest at six, eight, and ten per cent per
annum on the value of the land.</p>

<p class='c011'>Low prices, according to all standard writers on
political economy, are the direct results of a contracting
currency, and a consequent increasing scarcity of
money, and the cost of production is not only greatly
increased by inability of the producer to obtain money
except at high rates of interest, but the terms upon
which money can be had at all are often so exacting
as to discourage permanent improvement. The
farmer will not cultivate except for immediate crops
if he sees no hopeful outlook for the future, and not
only fears but expects that the mortgage he has given
will, in the end, cause his home to be transferred to
a purchaser at sheriff’s sale.</p>

<p class='c011'>The yield of the Morning mine has already largely
increased the volume of standard money all over the
world, and this may do much toward removing
some of the unfortunate conditions to which I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>referred; but such yield may also have a tendency
to discourage the loaning of money on long loans, for
men who have means to invest may prefer to place
them in property, the value of which must advance
with the increase of the volume of money, rather than
in loans, the value of which must remain stationary
absolutely, and cannot but diminish relatively.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been and will continue to be my purpose to
use the gold produced at the Morning mine, either in
the purchase of existing loans, or the making of new
loans, so that whatever of loss may come from diminution
of the purchasing power of a dollar may fall
not altogether upon those who have loaned money,
but in part upon those who have deliberately or accidentally
caused such increase. I suggest that if such
increase in the currency be caused by the government,
a similar moral obligation would rest upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The addition of $2,400,000,000 to the currency of
the country will unquestionably largely increase all
values. It will at the same time encourage—nay,
almost compel—capital to seek investment in active
industries rather than in dormant funds. For the present
it will supply those who can use money to advantage
with a sure and convenient method of obtaining
it at a cheap rate of interest, while its ultimate tendency
must be to eliminate interest on money from the
world’s transactions, and bring money to what I conceive
to be its true function—a measurer of values
only.</p>

<p class='c011'>When no interest can be obtained for the use of
money, then money will cease to be the most valuable
and become the least valuable form of property, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the investor will be required to share the risk, if not
the labor, of producing values, instead of leaving this
to others, while he absorbs the profits to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>I believe that civilization is ready for this forward
step. The discovery of gold enough to compel it may
have precipitated the movement, but the movement
would have come all the same if the Morning mine
had never been discovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is not a single benefit which the donation of
twenty-four hundred millions of gold will confer upon
the people of the United States that might not equally
be conferred by an act of Congress providing for the
issuance and loaning of the same number of paper
dollars, not based upon gold at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>The credit of this great government used for the
purpose of accommodating the business, increasing
the resources, and stimulating the industrial activity of
this great people, and, supported by the indestructible
and undepreciable security of land, would be quite as
solid a basis for twenty hundred millions of paper
dollars as five thousand tons of yellow metal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dearest Mother</span>: What an insufferable egotist
I must appear to you. A life made up of local coloring—a
central figure with no accessories—a record
of ways and means unwisely, perhaps, submitted to
you, since they may only pain you. Better a gray
and monotonous sea, without sail or sound, if so I
could spare you the burden of apprehension which
every anxious mother must feel for a destiny she
has helped to direct. Following the train of argument,
think you the loving Father acquits himself of
responsibility when a helpless soul is launched for
eternity? Truly no! and this conviction sustains my
courage, and makes me unafraid to do my heart’s
bidding.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been an observation that the thing we most
condemn in others, we shall find in ourselves. Many
years ago I conceived a prejudice against the popular
cry concerning the wrongs of woman, a movement
affirmatively named “woman’s rights,” for while it
undoubtedly aided some women in obtaining justice,
its aim was largely the gratification of some hysterical
ambition or some love of conspicuousness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Thus I am brought to question if, in my individual
case, I am not exaggerating evils and magnifying
wrongs by placing them under the strong light, if
not of worldly criticism, at least of self-love and secret
pride; if, instead of dealing soberly and wisely
with flesh and blood, I am not following an ideal, or
whether my matrimonial point of view is not interrupted
by such inappreciable angles as seldom vex
the eye of faith and perfect love.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these questions, and many more, I wish to
make clear to my own conscience and your mind,
that you may be able to advise me when, if ever, the
time shall come for me to ask your loving counsel.</p>

<p class='c007'>To speak more personally, I conclude, after mentally
reviewing the characteristics peculiar to my husband,
the baron, that his faults are less of malice
than of temperament, and that he would not really
sacrifice any actual interest of his wife, not even her
permanent peace of mind, any more than I would
compromise those of the baron. If it were not so, I
could less well afford the many hours of thought I
give toward the fashioning of apologies for him, lest
in my own mind I do him an injustice.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, so believing, I must take many things on trust,
and, after all, I am full of faults myself, no doubt of it.
You know it is a popular theory over here that
American girls must be broken like bronco horses
before they are fit for wives, and I must say that my
own mouth is a little tender to the foreign bit already.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have invitations to a grand ball, although I
have not yet seen them. Kindest love to papa, and a
heart full of devotion for you, as always. When will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>you write to tell me you are coming to your affectionate

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dearly Beloved Child</span>: In these revolutionary
times, the air thick with maledictions and curses, “the
putrid breath of poverty, and the beetling brow of labor,”
to quote the press, hot with greed for the
ground they are slowly but surely losing—in these
times I say, I am thankful that you, my child, are
resting in the security of strong and wise rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seems to be no end to the vindictiveness
of the common people here. Your father, as you
are aware, is president of the new Aerial Navigation
Company, and, although, as he says, his policy is unaggressive,
and his weight of counsel unswervingly
in the direction of the interests of the poor and the
laboring classes, they seem determined to make the
breach as wide as possible, and go so far as even to demand
a division of the proceeds of every enterprise,
based upon the labor of either brawn or brain, and
insolently propose to tax the companies to the extent
of what they call their “labor investment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What nonsense! It makes me so mad I don’t
know what to do. Papa says—he is always so conservative,
you know—that the poor fellow who effected
the invention of air navigation, really ought to have
been paid better for it, but that he was a genius, with
no common sense—none of them have, you know—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>nearly starved, at that; that there is a man out
West, whose name I have not heard, who is going to
make it very warm for men concerned in such transactions
as this, which he denounces as highway robbery,
and in a short speech, wherein he maintained
that labor was as much a factor and an investment as
capital, in all successful enterprise, he called one Jack
Spratt, and the other Jack Spratt’s wife, which simile
pleased me immensely. We don’t know where it is
going to end, but hope for the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, my darling, I want to say how gratified I
am at the contents of your last letter. In it I discern
a spirit of what Christians call humility, very
consistent and very encouraging, considering the noble
personage whom you are so lucky as to have
captured by your charms and graces alone, for of
course your fortune had nothing whatever to do
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If your husband were an American, I would advise
you to stand up for your rights. American husbands,
uxorious though they are, and they have earned the
name, bring you no title, have no legitimate entrée to
foreign courts, and even the most stupendous fortunes
only inoculate and leave a scar. Really, the only
clean business is an out and out marriage, love or
no love, though, for the matter of that, one must feel
toward the dear baron as the hero-worshiping woman
said concerning the wife of Henry Ward Beecher,
that she ought to be proud to bow her head and allow
the great divine to pluck every individual hair out
by the roots. “A most touching test of devotion,”
I hear you say.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Do write, my dear, and tell me all the court gossip.
Since the California practice of shooting obnoxious
editors has been introduced in Boston, there has
grown up a virtual censorship of the press hereabouts,
and the newspapers are as dull as death. Every
woman’s character is kept in a glass case, and one
would suppose the men graduated from a meetinghouse.
In fact, the reading public who lived upon
scandals are dying of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, hence, I have no news
to write you to-day. Present me with continued
assurance of high respect to the baron, and receive,
yourself, my undying love.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mother</span>: The grand ball, the mention
of which seems to catch your fancy, is to be given at
the Chateau d’Or, a magnificent edifice on the heights
overlooking the river. Its turrets, and domes, and
roofs, and arches, and balustrades, glitter against the
background of bluest skies like shining gold—hence
its name. Indeed, its architectural device is so cunningly
conceived as to catch and fill the eye with
radiant color like the facets<a id='t282'></a> of a diamond, while its
proportions suggest all the beauties of form to be
found in the scale of harmonized effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is just completed, and is a wonder. Its occupants
are not much talked about; indeed, I do not
even know who they are, though I fancy the baron
does, for I recall that he replied curtly to my question
concerning them, that I should not wish to know
them, by which I fancied they might be Americans.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Neither can I give you any idea of the bidden
guests, although, of course, it promises to be a magnificent
affair. As you know, in compliance with
custom, I could, in no event, make excuse for non-appearance
with my husband. Such women as accept
their titles and position from their lords, are expected
to follow, unquestioning, his leadership through
all social labyrinths, and I am no exception to the
rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dear mother, forgive me, if I say I feel very disinclined
to these gayeties. Since our experiences at
Mentone, I decided to give over all control of the exchequer
into the hands of the baron, accepting only a
regular stipend. I find this the only means of securing
harmony and altercations weary and depress me
overmuch. Wherefore it is I have lost interest in
handsome toilets, and therefor it is I shall have nothing
new for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did papa receive my letter acknowledging and
thanking him for his munificent gift? and does it occur
to you that it is a good deal of money to invest in
methods of pacification? But what is the remedy?
This is a question I am puzzling my head about to
a much larger extent, let me say, than about what I
shall wear to the ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron dines at home to-day, so I will close, in
order not to be a moment late. You see I am growing
to be a model wife, if not a heroic woman. I see
the baron from my window beating a poor dwarf, at
the entrance of the alley. He has lost at play. In
haste and love, dear ones, adieu.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Mother</span>: Is there but one depth for a
creature like him I call husband? What mockery in
a name! What have I suffered for him, and what
concealed in my pride! And this is my reward!—To
have been made the dupe of a dastardly plot to ensnare
cowardly victims! to have sullied my skirts
with the dust of a usurer’s and gambler’s den! to have
my name blazoned side by side with the modern
Cora Pearls in every court journal in Europe! to
have been led into the lair blindly, by one who is
sworn to be my protector! to have followed in faith
the man who could load the dice of his self-imposed
despair, with a wife’s dishonor!</p>

<p class='c007'>But I must remember that all this is a riddle to
you, and must read like the ravings of a maddened
brain, so I will give you the story of my shame and
rage, albeit it has probably already been telegraphed
over two continents. Verily, it is too sweet a morsel
to escape the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I believe I mentioned to you, invitations were
issued for a ball, to be given at the Chateau d’Or. I
noticed that the occurrence was making rather a stir,
and especially that the baron was unwontedly nervous
over the event, insomuch that when I proposed
sending regrets, he fell into a violent rage, and declared
that I would ruin him, past and future. Naturally,
I did not comprehend his meaning, but, seeming
to take it so much to heart, I readily consented
to accompany him, asking no further questions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Arrived at the place of what later proved to be a
scene of the most disgraceful orgies, we entered the
salon, and instantly my heart misgave me. There
was present a mixed assemblage of people, among
them a few whom I had met in the best circles—a few
who seemed equally out of place with myself—and
many of that nondescript quality found in every society,
who defy comment. But not until we were presented
to the receiving party, was my amazement at
its climax. I am not yet sufficiently in possession of
myself, to describe the magnificent apartments of the
interior of this most superb mansion. All that wealth
could bring from the uttermost ends of the earth, contributed
to the sumptuousness of these most artistic
apartments. No smallest detail had been forgotten
in the programme for this entertainment, even to the
grottoes with singing birds, and floes of ice in seas of
wine.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the recollection is hateful, and I hurry on. The
host was a tall, sinewy, middle-aged man, with a
strongly-marked Hebraic cast of face, and an oily, obsequious
manner, quite at variance with his prominent
features. He greeted us with an air of the most
profuse cordiality, and passed us along to a bevy of
much-painted and overdressed, or, rather, underdressed
women, who vied with each other in chattering
society phrases.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the first moment, an undeniable air of dissoluteness
pervaded the entire place, and I looked to the
baron for an explanation. He pressed my arm nervously,
and politely warned me to hold my tongue.
There was no mistaking the animus of this party. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>was revelry, riot, unrestraint. Answering a sign from
the host, the baron soon left my side, and joined the
convivialists, I being politely led to the main salon,
where there was dancing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleading indisposition, I declined to take part, and
remained aside observing the dancers. I noticed that
many of the women were singularly lovely and exquisitely
attired, but generally lacking in grace of
movement and aplomb. I observed, also, groups of
women, some of them deathly pale, others flushed
with indignation, evidently discussing the situation,
and the truth slowly dawned upon me that these
were women of the demi-monde, and that I had been
tricked into an attendance upon this reception.</p>

<p class='c007'>After two or three attempts I succeeded in bringing
the baron to my side, much the worse for wine but
quite docile. I demanded to be led to my dressing-room,
and at first he temporized. Finding me insistent,
he begged me to remain, promising to be
among the first to depart at the proper hour. His
conduct was unusually conciliatory, and when I referred
to the character of the entertainment, his manner
was full of conscious guilt, while he assured me
that he would explain everything later, but that he
dared not precipitate a scene by taking me home.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture Count Volenfeldt, whom we knew,
accompanied by the Prince of Waldeck, came our
way, and, saluting, faced us, and, remarking somewhat
satirically upon the unexpected numbers in attendance,
gave me an opportunity to ask if his wife were present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The countess is not here to-night,” replied the
count, a little dryly. “She is not well.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“And my wife is here,” put in the prince bluffly,
“but she will not be longer than till I shall have made
my way through this crush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us join the prince’s party and leave this place
at once,” said I.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the music had for the moment ceased, and
loud laughing and shrill voices, mingled with smoother
tones and words of entreaty, were heard, and there was
a simultaneous movement toward the dressing-rooms
and places of exit. Suddenly word came back that
the doors were locked, and the frightened lackeys had
fled from their posts, with orders that no one should
be allowed to leave the house. Then followed a scene
of consternation and confusion,—wives demanding
redress from their husbands, and husbands denouncing
the violation of hospitality by their host, and through
all the din the guttural tones and the piping taunts
of the unsainted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently the tall form of Herr Rosenblatt showed,
a head above the crowd, adding to his length the
height of a fauteuil, upon which he balanced, with a
drunken man’s nicety of poise, for he was drunk but
coherent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have met together, as we
have met before, for the purpose of proving which man
among us has the staying qualities, and who is willing
to risk his money in this little game. You come to
me and say, ‘Open your doors, my lady wishes to go,’
but how many of you dare to go when I say to those
who will go, ‘To-morrow I shall expose you, to-morrow
you will sign over your estates to me, to-morrow you
shall be ruined and I shall be winner.’ I did not make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>this party for your money—nor that you shall play, at
my tables and lose, for that you have already done,
but one thing I want which money will not buy,—social
recognition,—and that you shall give me. You will
not leave my house, gentlemen, till morning. The
ladies will not talk about this entertainment. It is too
beautiful; they will not attempt to describe it. Now,
gentlemen, I bid you to stay and I shall make myself
sure that you enjoy yourself. These remarks make
it long for the champagne to wait, and the ladies,
poor things, will be wanting refreshments. And such
refreshments! Oh, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</span></i>, that the gods could sup
with us,” and the speaker was helped caressingly to
the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>My dear scandalized mother, what did I do? I, an
American girl, with the blood of heroes in my veins?
Why, I remained and supped and smiled with the
others, for not a man even tried the doors. Thereafter
there was no restraint. It was, as I have said,
a night of orgies. Each man felt that he was no more
deeply involved than his neighbor, and that Herr
Rosenblatt had told the truth when he said to all, that
he held their fates in his fist, otherwise they would
not have been there.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was right, the affair was not talked about except
among themselves. But some mischievous astral,—some
ubiquitous spirit of a reporter,—was floating
about, and before twenty-four hours had elapsed, the
court journals had published an account of the whole
affair, comments included.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dearest mother, this letter is long, and I can write
no more to-night. I have decided upon nothing so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>far. So soon as I have done so, I will write, but I must
have time for reflection. In tears and love adieu.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My dear, darling Papa</span>: I have your telegram
telling me to come home without delay, also message
for the American Minister in case I should need it,
as well as that to my banker. Wise and loving provisions
all, for my fortune is squandered, my home
dishonored, and my heart more than broken, in that I
perfidiously assumed to give a love which was not

you understand me when I say that all this I have
brought upon myself? I was not a child; I had a fitting
experience and was of sound judgment. I knew
I did not love this man as it was in me to love, indeed,
I felt for him neither the admiration nor esteem which
must form the basis of genuine passion. I respected,
aye, coveted his position, his title, and I brought myself
feebly to hope that some day I should be a devoted
wife. I staked my future, as he staked my fortune,
and lost. If the money was not his own to lose,
neither was my heart mine to lose.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other test I have applied, and the result is in
his favor. If I did love the baron as I might
love another, would I be so ready with my revenge?—Verily,
no; I would wear my life out in the effort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>to cancel or correct the wrong against myself. Sacrifice
is the residue found in love’s crucible; passion
is the flux which passes off in the process of retorting.
In my crucible, alas! I find nothing but dross—the
more the pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so I have decided to remain in Berlin for the
present. I am sketching out my plans for the future,
but they are crude and unformed, and are of a sort of
lighthouse quality, meant to warn people of the rocky
places. But more of this anon. Tell my mother,
dearest papa, how condemned I feel to give her so
much agony on my account. Don’t worry; I will
be quite happy now that my mind is settled. Possibly
we shall come over in a few weeks, but only possibly.
I am sorry I wrote my last to mamma with so
much feeling. Good-night, and good-by.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Shut that door!” thundered the baron from
over the washbowl in a Pullman car, as he stood half-dressed
in a small apartment, taking his morning bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you addressin’?” answered a pale-faced
young man—who was passing—from under a broad,
stiff-brimmed hat, the crown of which was encircled
with the skin of a huge rattlesnake. “I reckon you
want your nose set back about an inch anyhow, and
I’m the man that can perform that little blacksmithin’
job right here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron glanced at the gray-clad figure, with its
gleaming silk ’kerchief knotted carelessly, and arms
akimbo, then down at the high boots with their fair-leather
tops, behind which gleamed the ebony and
silver handle of a bowie knife, and then, meeting
the steady, mild blue eyes of the Arizona cowboy, said
apologetically:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beg pardon. I thought it was the madam.
She just left the compartment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did, did you?” said the youth. “That’s
what I allowed, en that’s why I tuk an interest in ye.
Look a yer. That woman ain’t no slouch, and Gila
monsters like you ain’t popular nohow, yearabouts,
so you jest keep a civil tongue in your mutton head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>an’ it’ll be all right.” And with the movement of a
leopard, he glided quietly away, while the baron, after
softly closing the door, sank into the nearest sofa,
and awaited the return of his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Benson,” shouted the keen-eyed brakeman.
“Change cars for Tombstone, Nogales, Hermosillo,
Guaymas, and all points on the Gulf of California.
Passengers for Tucson, Phoenix, Yuma, San Diego,
Los Angeles, and San Francisco remain in the car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron’s party consisted of the baroness and
her maid, Professor and Mrs. Thornton, Doctor Eustace,
who had accompanied the Von Eulaws from
Europe, and Miss Winters, an old friend of the baroness
and a graduate of a woman’s law school, who
had left a thriving practice in Denver rather than sacrifice
her life in the pursuit of a profession for which
no woman is really fitted either mentally or physically.
The party was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> to Coronado Beach—the
baron as one of a score of representatives selected by
the emperor of Germany to attend the “dynamic exposition,”
as it was generally designated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six weeks or less before the Prime Minister of every
recognized civilized power had received a letter
couched in the following phrase.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>David Morning</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The fame of Morning, as the greatest wealth owner
in the world, was now coextensive with civilization,
and his invitation had been promptly and generally
accepted. The Emperor Wilhelm II. chose for the
German delegation, five of his most distinguished
field marshals, five high officials of the German navy,
five great civil engineers, and five members of the diplomatic
corps. Among the latter was the Baron
Von Eulaw, who was indebted for his appointment—although
he did not know it-to an urgent unofficial
representation made by the American envoy to the
German Chancellor, to the effect that, for certain personal
reasons, Mr. David Morning greatly desired the
attendance of the Baron and Baroness Von Eulaw.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Such a request from such a source was favorably considered,
and the baron—greatly to his astonishment,
for he had not been in favor at court since the affair
at the Chateau d’Or—received the appointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Thornton and Doctor Eustace had received
invitations to attend, and the baron, finding it
convenient to leave Berlin in advance of the other
members of the German delegation, sailed from Hamburg
late in January, and, after a brief visit with his
wife’s parents at Roxbury, the party journeyed to the
Pacific Coast, to enjoy its climate and scenery for a
month or more in advance of the “dynamic exposition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel,” said the baroness, as the train rolled out
of Benson, “as if I had a renewed lease of life; these
delicious airs stir the blood like wine, and, entranced
with the perfume of almond and oleander and jasmine
bloom, I forget that it is still midwinter in the East.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are drugged, madame,” said the doctor,
slowly passing his finger scrutinizingly over the soft
flesh upon his hand. “You could be lured to your
death in a few hours by—I wonder what ails my
hand?” he broke off meditatively, still feeling for
the insidious and evasive little hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cactus, sir,” put in an “old-timer” across the
car, “and you ain’t got no use to look for it, if it
does feel like an oxgad. I could hev tole you when
I see you foolin’ around them fine flowers at the
station, but you fellers hev all got to try it once;
another time you’ll know better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is Mr. Morning’s state, I believe,” observed
the doctor, after the laugh at his expense had subsided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>and all sat dreamily looking away to the dimly-outlined
mountains in the distance, “and we must be
nearing the place of the wonderful gold deposit, with
the results of which he is rapidly revolutionizing the
world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are right, sir,” said a bright-eyed, smooth-shaven,
portly gentleman, of forty years of age, who
occupied an adjoining seat. “It is Morning’s state
in every sense of the word. He has made it—industrially,
politically, and socially. His enterprise and
money have constructed great reservoirs, and laced
the land with irrigating canals, and changed its wastes
into orchards, and its deserts into lawns. He is the
idol of its people, as he ought to be, and his ideas
are embodied in our constitution and laws. They are
all the product of his thought, from marriage contract-laws
to abolition of trial by jury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abolition of trial by jury,” said Doctor Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; at least the jury is composed of judges,
instead of men who don’t know the plaintiff from the
defendant, and we have no Supreme Court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No jury, and no Supreme Court!” observed Miss
Winters. “What a capital idea. I shall come here to
practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, miss, if you practice law here, and wish to
patronize the twelve men in a box, or enjoy the luxury
of an appeal, you must bring your case in the
United States Court, or take it there. In our State
courts we have dispensed with all that ancient rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rubbish!” exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so,” rejoined the stranger. “The judicial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>system in vogue elsewhere than in Arizona is as much
a relic of barbarism as slavery or polygamy. It is no
more fitted to the wants and enlightenment of the age
than the canal boat for traveling, or the flint lock
musket for shooting pigeons. Suppose you wish to
recover a piece of land from a jumper in California or
Maine, and one side or the other demands a jury trial.
Every good citizen who is busy shirks duty as a juryman.
Every intelligent citizen who reads the newspapers
forms an opinion and is excused. From the
residue—which is sure to contain both fools and
knaves—you get twelve clerks, mechanics, laborers,
merchants, farmers, and idlers—none of whom have
any training in untangling complicated propositions,
weighing evidence, remembering principles of law
and logic, and according to each fact its just and relative
importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After these twelve men have listened to a muddle
of testimony, objections, law papers, and speeches,
concluding with bewildering instructions, which half of
them fail to remember, and the other half fail to understand,
they retire to the jury room and guess out
a verdict. The losing party appeals, and, after wearisome
delay, the Supreme Court decides that ‘someone
has blundered,’ and, without attempting to correct
the error by a proper judgment, sends the case back
for another trial, another batch of blunders, and
another appeal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how does your Arizona system correct the
evils you depict?” queried the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We commence at the other end of the puzzle,”
said the stranger. “We place the Supreme Court in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the jury box. We have a preliminary court of three
judges in each judicial district. Every plaintiff must
first present his case informally to this court. He
states on oath the facts he expects to prove, and gives
the names of his witnesses. Any willful mis-statement
of a material fact, is perjury. If the evidence would,
if uncontradicted, entitle him to recover, an order
is issued giving him leave to sue. In practice, not
one-half of the proposed suits survive the ordeal.
The saving of time and money is great. Under the
old system, after a jury had been impaneled, and
days consumed, the plaintiff might, after all, be nonsuited.
Now it is all disposed of in an hour or two.
The preliminary court practically puts an end to all
blackmailing litigation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And when leave to sue is granted, what is the
next step?” inquired the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The case is brought under the same rules of procedure
as of old,” replied the stranger, “with only
such changes as were necessary to adapt litigation to
the new conditions. We have three judicial districts
in the State, and nine judges for each district. Upon
questions of law arising during the trial, the judges
pass by a majority vote, and in making the final decision,
from which there is no appeal, seven judges
must concur.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does this system satisfy litigants?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Much better than the old method,” replied the
stranger. “What honest litigant would not prefer
to have his rights determined by nine men, who were
trained to sift truth from error, who were honest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>just, and without other duties to distract them, rather
than by twelve men such as ordinarily find their way
into the jury box? The judgment of seven out of
nine judges will be as nearly right as human conclusions
can well be, and people affected by it are
better satisfied—even when they lose—than by the
guess of a stupid and sleepy jury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can the courts you have organized attend to all
the business?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Easily,” was the rejoinder. “No time is consumed
in procuring juries, and much less in objections to
testimony. Arguments are abbreviated, and instructions
eliminated. In practice, four cases out of five
are decided from the bench.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are not the salaries of so many judges a heavy
tax upon you?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The system costs the public treasury less than the
old one,” was the reply. “Many court expenses are
dispensed with, and the expense to litigants is reduced,
although the loser is now compelled to pay
the fee of his opponent’s attorney, which is fixed by
the court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you have no court of appeals, I suppose no
record is made of court proceedings,” remarked the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, each court room is provided with one of
the new automatic noiseless receiving and printing
phonographs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how about lawyers who have bad cases?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They endeavor to take them into the United
States Court, where the old practice prevails.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beg pardon, ma’am,” said the Pullman conductor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>approaching Mrs. Thornton, “but we are passing
over the new line, which runs north of Gila River,
and a view may be had of the sleeping Montezuma
now, and the passengers generally like to see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sleeping Montezuma! What is that?” asked
the lady addressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the giant figure of an Indian resting on his
back on the top of the mountain. You can see it
now quite plainly from the right-hand windows of
the car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And across the plain—in centuries gone densely
peopled by some prehistoric race, and then for centuries
a waste, and, since the completion of the Gila
Canal, a checker-board of orchard, vineyard, and
meadow, the eye looked upon the lavender-tinted
mountains to the northward, and it required no aid
from the imagination to behold, upon the summits of
those mountains, the profile of a stately figure and
majestic face, with a crown of feathers upon the brow,
lying upon its back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once there lived, in the shadow of this giant, a race,
of which traces may still be found in mounds containing
pottery, and in the ruins of great aqueducts,
and in stone houses seven stories in height, a portion
of the walls of which are still standing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Indians hereabouts have a story,” said the
conductor, “to the effect that Montezuma went to
sleep, when the sun dried up the waters, and his people
died, and they say now that Morning’s canal is
making the country green again, the old chief will
awaken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were saying,” said Doctor Eustace, by way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of suggestion to the stranger, “that there are some
peculiar marriage contract laws here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is all expressed, sir, in the preamble to the law,
and in the law itself, a copy of which I happen to
have with me, as I am on the way to attend court at
Yuma. Here it is,” and he offered the book to Professor
Thornton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Read it aloud, professor,” said the doctor, and
the professor read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Senate and Assembly of the State of Arizona
recognizes the truth that not easy divorce laws, but
easy marriage laws, are at the root of the conjugal
evil; that men and women have been accustomed to
marry, disagree, and divorce in less time than should
have been allowed for a proper period of betrothal;
that the loose system now prevailing often results in
children destitute of the inherent virility of virtue and
affection; that no adequate defenses have hitherto
been builded for the protection of young females too
unthoughtful and too trusting; that the laws underlying
the physical as well as the mental constitution,
with their multiple of subtile, gravitating, and repellant
forces, have hitherto been wholly unstudied, or
disregarded; that the arbitrary conditions of society
compel woman to accept marriage, in violation of her
higher aims; that in certain human organizations the
conditions created by propinquity are altogether false
and ephemeral; that certain other human organizations
are, by nature, filled with inordinate vanity
and self-love, which qualities, beguiling the judgment,
constitute fickleness and instability of purpose, and
that the true solution of the great social problem is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>likely to be found in preventive rather than in remedial
laws. Therefore, be it enacted”—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold up, John,” said Dr. Eustace. “That is all
my mentality can assimilate without a rest. Are you
not reading from an essay by Mona Caird, or a novel
by Tolstoi? Is that really and truly the preamble of a
law enacted by a Western Legislature? Have all the
cranks, and all the theorists, and all the moonstruck,
long-haired, green-goggled reformers on earth, been
turned loose in Arizona?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor,” said the professor solemnly, “the truth
is a persistent fly, that cannot be brushed away with
the wisps of ridicule. The Arizona legislators have
fearlessly attempted to deal with conditions which
every close observer of our social life knows to be
existent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa,” said the baroness, interestedly, “in what
way is it proposed to deal with the problem? Please
read further.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The law is too lengthy,” said the professor, after
glancing over a few pages, “to be read in detail, but
I will summarize it for you. Marriages are declared
void unless the parties procure a license, which can
only be issued by an examining board of men and
women, composed in part of physicians, and in part
of graduates of some reputable school, dedicated to
physiological observations and esoteric thought and
investigation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything about ability to boil a potato or sew on
a button?” interrupted the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Peace, scoffer,” said the professor. “It seems
to be required that all applicants for license shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>have had an acquaintance of at least one year, and be
under marriage engagement for six months, and shall
pass examination by the board upon their mutual eligibility,
as expressed through temperament, complexion,
tastes, education, traits of character, and general
conditions of fitness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is red hair, or a habit of snoring, or a fondness
for raw onions, considered a disqualification?” queried
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor, ignoring the interruption, continued:
“It is required that one or both of the applicants
shall possess property of sufficient value, to support
both of them for one year, in the manner of life to
which the proposed wife has been accustomed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A gleam of common sense at last in a glamour of
moonshine,” said the doctor. “But how can such
a marriage law be enforced?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The act provides,” said the professor, “that
children born to parties who have no license, shall be
deemed born out of wedlock, and all such children,
as well as all children born to extreme poverty or
degrading influences, may be taken from their parents
and educated at the public expense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does this experiment of turning the State
into a moral kindergarten for adults, and wet-nursery
for infants, succeed?” said Doctor Eustace to the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The law was enacted only a few weeks since,”
replied the gentleman, “and it is too soon to answer
your question.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! have you any more of such revolutionary
legislation?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“Nothing so important as the marriage contract
act, but on page 72 you will find some provisions of
law which may interest you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Women who perform equal service with men
shall be entitled to recover an equal sum for their
labor, and all contracts made in derogation of this
right shall be void.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” applauded Miss Winters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the doctor read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The men who represent the State of Arizona in
the United States Senate shall be chosen by a majority
of the voters, and not by the Legislature, as in other
States of the Union, and no man, however favored,
shall be eligible for the position whose property interests,
justly estimated, exceed in value the sum of
$100,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will exclude Mr. Morning from the millionaires’
club, will it not?” queried Dr. Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” answered the stranger, “but he favored
the law. Of course, under the United States Constitution,
this section is not legally operative; but it is
morally binding, and the Legislature has always
elected to the Senate gentlemen who were previously
designated by the people at the polls, and thus far
no man suspected of solvency has ventured to be a
candidate. Arizona is friendly to progressive legislation.
You will find our law for the prevention of
cruelty to animals on page 56; it may interest you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any person or persons convicted of having
beaten, abused, underfed, overworked, or otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>maltreated any horse, mule, dog, or other animal of
whatever kind, may thereafter be assaulted and beaten
by any person who may desire to undertake such
task, without the assailant being responsible civilly or
criminally for such assault.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” said the doctor, “to quote a Boston girl
on Niagara Falls, ‘is neat, simple, and sufficient.’
Have you any further novelties in the way of legislation
to offer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our law of libel is in advance of all other states,”
said the stranger; “you will find it on page 163.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any man or woman or newspaper firm lending
themselves to the dissemination of scandal, or defamation
of private character, to the moral detriment of
innocent parties, shall, on conviction, be adjudged
outlaws, and may be lawfully beaten or killed at the
pleasure of the party injured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord,” said the doctor, piously raising his eyes,
“now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for
mine eyes have beheld thy glory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We take a great deal of pride in that libel law,”
said the stranger. “It has inspired a degree of courtesy
on the part of Arizona editors that would have
made Lord Chesterfield ashamed of himself. The
Yuma <cite>Sentinel</cite>, which was accustomed to personal
journalism, lately alluded to a convicted highwayman
as ‘a gentleman whose ideas on the subject of property
differ from those of a majority of his fellow-citizens;’
and the Tucson Star, which used to be the
chief of slangwhangers, reviewed a sermon and spoke
of Judas Iscariot as ‘that disciple whose conduct in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>receiving compensation in money from the Romans
for his services as a guide, has caused his memory to
be visited by all religious denominations with great,
and probably not altogether undeserved, criticism.’
But we are at Yuma, sir, and I must bid you good-by.
Boats run up the river from here to Castle Dome.
There is an excellent hotel here. Tourists usually
stop over to visit the Gonzales place, and I suppose
you will not neglect the opportunity. The house is
a marvel of beauty. It was built by direction of Mr.
Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does he live there when at home?” queried the
baroness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, madame! The Gonzales family nursed
Morning through an attack of fever, after he was shot
by the Apaches near the old Gonzales hacienda several
years ago. The Señorita Murella never left his
bedside for weeks. Really, the doctors say the girl
saved his life. He was, naturally, very grateful, and,
when he recovered, he bought the Castle Dome
rancheria from the Indians, and had a rock tunnel
run into the Colorado River, and took out the water
and carried it in irrigating canals over a thousand
acres of land, which he had planted in oranges, lemons,
vines, olives, and other fruit. It will pay a princely
revenue to the Gonzales people in a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Morning ordered built upon the dome overlooking
the river the most beautiful marble palace on the
coast, and they say it is not surpassed anywhere on
earth. The whole business must have cost him several
millions, but money is nothing to him. The
place is kept up in princely style by the Señora Gonzales
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and her daughter. They entertain a great deal
of company, and are always delighted to welcome
strangers who may visit the place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I suppose that Aladdin is a constant visitor
at his palace?” sneered the baron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Morning? Oh, no; strangely enough, he has
never been near the place since its completion, two
years ago! Too busy, I suppose, helping the world
out of the mud. But he is on the coast now, preparing
for his ‘dynamite exposition,’ and may put in
an appearance here.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='small'>“A hospitable gate unbarred to all.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“All aboard for Castle Dome,” and the baron’s
party filed up the carpeted gang plank, and looked
smilingly about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have often heard of the sumptuousness of
the Mississippi steamers, now grown traditional, but
this exceeds even their reputation,” commented Miss
Winters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the Morning line, madame,” answered
the gaudily-dressed steward boastfully, “and they
do nothing by halves, you know,” and he pompously
led the way to the ladies’ saloon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Except by half millions,” returned the doctor
jocosely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These steamers were built for the accommodation
of the people who came to the World’s Fair at
Chicago,” explained the steward. “Morning’s a
queer sort of fellow”—and he grew confidential.
“He could have brought his air ships and new-fangled
things, such as he had on exhibition at the fair, but
he wouldn’t. He said it was kind o’ throwing off on
nature, that God never made but one Colorado River,
and he for one hadn’t the brass to discount it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you have many visitors belonging to the nobility?”
asked Mrs. Thornton, evidently inclined to
change the conversation from its personal trend.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“Oh, lots of ’em! There’s a Spanish count and an
Italian prince stopping up at the Gonzales place now.
The Italian has been there some time, making himself
solid with the señorita, I reckon. And we are
expecting a party this week, Baron Von Boodle, or
some such name, with his friends”—here the baron
rose abruptly and walked out of the saloon—“at
least Mr. Morning telegraphed the captain from San
Diego that when this party arrived he meant to run
over here and make his first visit to Castle Dome,
which will be an event, for, after all the millions of
money he has spent on the place, he has never been
near it, and everybody is wondering at it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a night’s rest at the great Rio Colorado
Hotel, built upon the bluff at Yuma, the party had
made an early start, and had been on board the <em>Undine</em>
for some time before the line was thrown in and
the steamer began to move.</p>

<p class='c007'>The steward bustled away, and the baroness rose,
with a deep breath of relief, and walked to the mirror.
It may have been observed of many women that any
new or sudden sensation or condition or emotion suggests
a looking-glass. Not that they see or are thinking
of themselves, but they seem thus best able to
collect their thoughts. So it was with this woman,
only that now she did observe two very bright eyes
and a radiant face, with the swift blood coursing back
from her cheeks, across the smooth white surface of
her neck, to the closely-defined growth of hair—that
oracle of beauty which no ugly woman ever wore,
whatever her features. She turned quickly away,
and, following the doctor and her father, the three
ladies went out to view the scenery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“You observe this bend in the river,” a voice was
saying, “where many a poor fellow has gone to his
death, for there swoops the most fatal pool of eddies,
perhaps, to be found in the whole channel of these
whimsical waters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness turned to look for the speaker, whose
voice seemed familiar, and there, under the shade of
the awning, in full silhouette, looking in the face of
her husband, with whom he was pleasantly conversing,
stood David Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her first thought was to retreat to the saloon and
wait for him to present himself, but as his swift eye
swept the deck, he caught sight of her face, and came
quickly over, followed by the baron, saying, as he
cordially took her hand, and held it closely for a long
time, “I enjoy one advantage over you, baron, my
acquaintance with the baroness dates back of yours.
I hope she has not forgotten me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman made no reply to this remark; she
simply said, “How do you do, Mr. Morning,” and
presented him to her friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brief trip up the river among the cliffs and cascades
and whirlpools and caves and cañons and
towering cathedral rocks, furnished prolific and auspicious
topics for conversation, but it need not be
said that neither the baroness nor Mr. Morning
knew altogether what they were talking about. She
could not fail to see the pupils of his sea-grey eyes
grow very large when he looked at her, and he in
turn observed that she scarcely looked at him at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor talked a little dryly at first, and Mrs.
Thornton sat apart, evidently nursing her chagrin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>for Mr. Morning was at this moment not only the
wealthiest but the most famous and powerful man in
all the world, and, had he sought it, could have obtained
orders of high nobility from every crowned
head in Europe. The baron, who would have seen
“Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt,” if that brow
possessed the attribute of Midas, looked at the situation
from an altogether different standpoint, and was
thinking at what period of the new-formed acquaintance
it would be prudent to ask the loan of a few,
or, possibly, more than a few, thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently the boat rounded into a little cove and
stopped. The brief but eventful journey was over,
and the party stepped from the boat to a flight of
marble-flagged steps, leading up to shining floors, out
of which arose columns supporting a light roof in
Pagoda style. Easy swinging seats, with hammocks
and tables, with a few racks and stands, completed
the pretty “Rest” for the landing, and the party began
to look about for the path of ascent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a tinkling sound was heard, and, softly as
if it fell from the clouds, a car, sumptuously carpeted,
cushioned, and canopied, appeared before them. It
was, evidently, meant for the accommodation of the
party, and one by one they stepped in. Morning
was the last to follow, and as he came aboard and
closed the plate-glass door, it shut with a tinkle, and
the car arose, moving proportionately aslant as the
grade of the terrace—which had been fashioned and
grown in the short space of two years—inclined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My invention works like a charm,” Morning was
heard to mutter to the outer air, as they neared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>summit and surveyed the height. The awe-filling
overhanging crags, thousands of centuries old, had
been blasted and chiseled and coaxed into shelves,
and steps, and nooks, and resting-places, softly carpeted
with moss, and decorated with growing ferns
and lichens. The wind came down the river and
shook the leaves above their heads, and stirred the
birds into a flood of song, and larks sat upon the twigs
and warbled with joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only two years,” said Miss Winters, as they
stepped from the car; “’tis not so long in which to
make a beautiful world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is much more difficult to people it with the
right sort,” mused Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The first builders had to try that two or three
times, if my memory serves me,” remarked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are these people of the right sort?” asked Mrs.
Thornton significantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness shot a quick glance at Morning, and
looked over at her rather too loquacious maternal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am too much of an ingrate to answer for them,”
said Morning, undismayed. “I only know that I owe
them my life, and that I have never had the grace to
come and thank them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had now arrived at the main entrance to the
grounds, and the scene presented was one of indescribable
beauty and splendor. The dazzling proportions
of the structure rose into the air with such exceeding
lightness and grace of outline, melting away
against the silvery softness of the clouds, that it
seemed swinging in the ambient air, and only for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>cornices and columns and spires and turrets of onyx
and agate which defined the outlines against the sky,
one would look to see it float away like dissolving
views of the Celestial City. The magnificent dome
was rounded with bent and many-colored glasses, the
eloquent figures storying events of history both classic
and local, in pigments not known since the days of
Donatello, who went mad because his figure could
not speak. And there, upon its pedestal of purest
alabaster, stood the chaste statue of Psyche, just as
Morning had hewn it out of his captious fancy so long
ago, and Cupid opposite, half eager, half evasive, and
restless. Ah, well! and he looked into the deep, appreciative
eyes of the woman by his side, and said not
a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having selected the most thoroughly skilled architects,
artists, and artisans, and no limit having been
placed to expenditure, it was evident that every detail
of Morning’s plan had been faithfully executed. But
beyond this his power, or, rather, his supervision or
direction, had ceased. At last it was the estate and
home of the Gonzales family and not his own, and
concerning its management, or the manner in which
they should enjoy it, he did not offer even a suggestion.
Morning’s instructions, left with the Bank of
California more than two years before, were to pay all
checks signed by the Señora or the Señorita Gonzales,
no matter what amount, and charge them to his account.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gonzales family had taken their good fortune
with great equanimity. Their inclinations led them
to a generous and exceedingly promiscuous hospitality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>and they had not hesitated to arrange the ménage of
their household without regard to conventionalities.
Instead of the solemn and ubiquitous functionary at
the open door, there was vacancy, while the party
stood upon the tessellated floor of the broad vestibule
for several minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently a young Spaniard in boots and clanking
spurs, with silver-laced sombrero and flaming tie,
threw wide the door, and simultaneously Morning
caught a glimpse through an open court of a female
figure leaning upon the rosewood balustrade, mounted
with a cable of silver, which surrounded a corridor,
and idly tossing with her fan the light, half-curling
locks of a man who sat upon a low seat, resting his
head against her knee.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only a glance as the sun strikes against the
steel, sharply cutting its way upon the eye, or like the
incisive impress of some exceptional face in passing,
whereby one seizes every detail of color and form,
void of conscious effort. It was easy to recognize the
graceful outline of the swaying figure as she sat poised
under the sunlight, and swift and unbidden even as
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i> was, the senses of David Morning
thrilled with gladness. Was it the sight of Murella
again that sent that shaft of ecstasy through his soul?
or was it the all up-building, all-leveling lesson that
the Señorita Gonzales was being amused?</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrival of the party had been manifestly unexpected,
and no formal announcement was made, but
no sooner had they entered the magnificent reception
hall at one extremity than Señorita Gonzales appeared
at the other. She entered with a movement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>most exquisite grace, robed, rather than dressed, in a
gown of acanthus green satin, flowing in the back from
the half-bared neck to the gold-embroidered border of
the demi-train. The front was gathered at the shoulder
and fell with lengths of creamy lisse to the perfect
foot, with its slippers of gold. A corselet of rich embroideries
rounded the waist. The sleeves were
loosely puffed and draped with softest lace to the white
and flexible wrist, while the web-like lace of her mantilla
rested lightly upon the shining coils of her abundant
hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. Morning advanced toward the center of the
room to greet his beautiful hostess, she drew an audible
breath, and lifted her finely-arched brows, but no
sign betrayed other emotion. Mr. Morning presented
his friends in the most casual and easy manner, but
when the Baroness Von Eulaw came forward, taller
by some inches than the Señorita Gonzales, and with
an exquisite manner was about to speak, the little
hostess, with an air of special affability and simplicity,
asked, showing her small white teeth the while:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“To who owe I a the honor of this visite of a noble
baroness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a bombshell in satin and lace which fell at
the feet of Morning, and for an instant he saw no way
to the rescue of the baroness. Then, rallying, he
quickly replied:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the reputation for hospitality of the fair owner
of this house, and that of her charming family.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I no know if my name travel so long time a,”
she rejoined, looking at Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron then came forward, and, politely holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>her fingers, said in Spanish, “I hope that the
Señorita and Señora Gonzales are quite well, as who
should not be in this Italy of rare delights?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Italy! that is the home of my parteekler
friend. He paint Italia, he sing Italia, and he make
me promise for go many times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That settles it,” Morning muttered sententiously,
but no one heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the conversation became general, the baroness
commenting kindly upon the encroachments upon
the time of the señorita in receiving curious visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” retorted Murella with pretty nonchalance,
“I no care! I lofe amuse myself,” leading the way
to the main saloon. “I haf always parteekler frent,
same as baroness, ess it not?” and she sank indolently
into the cushioned depths of a primrose sofa,
waving the baroness to a place beside her, and leaving
the party to make choice of seats.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glance at the original design and superb appointments
of this interior suggested the incongruity of
hammocks and <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ollas</span></i>, yet here they were many times
repeated, for “ice is the devil’s nectar,” runs a Spanish
proverb, and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla</span></i> has no rival save the mescal
jug.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every well-to-do Mexican family keeps beneath its
roof a corps of female retainers, who are neither servants
nor guests, but something between the two.
They dine—except on occasions—at the family board,
and mingle always at the family gathering, but they
assist in the household labors, and sometimes, though
not often, receive a stated money compensation.
They are usually relatives, more or less distant, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>mistress of the household. The beautiful casa and
great wealth of the Gonzales family had nearly depopulated
the neighboring Mexican State of Sonora
of all the needy Alvarados who could claim kinship
with the Donna Maria, and a dozen of these señoritas
now appeared shyly at the doors, their mantillas
closely drawn, though the day was warm, and many
voices and excellent music were heard from all quarters
of the house and grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few moments the Señora Gonzales, with her
brother, Don Manuel Alvarado, who acted as major-domo
of the estate, were presented, but the señora
soon glided away unobserved, leaving her brother to
the honors of guide over the mansion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very beautiful,” spoke Murella with apparent
naiveté, as they arose to follow the party who
had preceded them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The smile of the baroness was tinged with bitterness
as she turned to look into the Madonna face beside
her, and ventured to reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Señor Morning lofes you like heaven and the
angels,” she continued unctuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Señorita, you forget that I have a husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he jealous?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely no,” replied the baroness sincerely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I no know what you mean a.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean that I owe a wife’s duty to the baron,”
slowly, with rising color.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what you owe a to the other fellow?” meaning
Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness was too much confused to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know him a long time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Before I married the baron and went abroad.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>“And you lofe him all these a year? Oh thunner!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Murella’s English must be taken with many grains
of allowance. The strongest words in a foreign or
unfamiliar tongue seem ineffectual and weak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must plead the indulgence of a guest,” laughed
the baroness, “and withdraw myself from the searching
operations of your cunning catechism, or turn the
lights upon you. How long have you known—”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the señorita had softly glided away, standing
apart and giving hurried orders for luncheon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning was in a dilemma. It will have been observed
that, after the first moment of greeting, Murella
had given him no farther thought. Gratitude is
not with the Spaniard one of the cardinal virtues, as
he was aware, so that was an unvexed question. If
his name had not been so prominently before the
world, doubtless they would—the entire family included—have
forgotten it ere this. But was it pique,
was it pride, or was it embarrassment, that led Murella
to thus overlook him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Certainly she had recognized the baroness at the
first glance, to his amazement and bewilderment, for
the episode of her examination and temporary custody
of the photograph was unknown to him, and
just so surely her first impulse had been to render
that lady as uncomfortable as possible. But, with her
usual swift sagacity, she had, with an eye single to
her own cunning tactics, quite changed her base of
action, and, with admirable finesse, proceeded at once
to make a friend of the baroness, through her charming
frankness and unsophisticated confidences. The
steady, unflinching eye of Morning, therefore, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>trained as the eagle’s to catch the fiercest rays of the
noonday sun, could no more follow the erratic and
elusive movements of the elfish fancy of this fascinating
woman than the eye of his horse could follow
the flash of a meteor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, señora,” said Murella to the baroness a
moment later, “I know the ting you was ask a me,
how long time I know Señor Morning lofe a you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness knew that she had not meant to ask
any such question, but rather how long the señorita
had known Mr. Morning. But she had scarcely
opened her lips when Murella talked on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You tink I no know lof when a I see a? Eh!
what that on his face when he a tak a your hand for
make a me know you Baroness Von Eulaw? Eh?
what you call proud, courage, lof, beautiful life!”
and her flashing eyes burned like stars in heaven’s
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strange caprice! the track was cold over which she
had set out to run the race for a life, and many a prize
had been won and thrown away since then, and now
she was burning with the wish that her rival should
gain that which she had lost. Was it magnanimity,
or was it a natural-born desire to defraud some man
of his marital rights, and give some woman a victory?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now we will go to the Morning room so I call
a;” and together they walked over the exquisite
mosaic floors, and halls of parquetry, and stairway
glittering as the sun, and figures of classic art looked
down, and fold on fold of hues of soft-blent shadows
dropped from tinted panes and fell around them. In
apparently the most casual way they passed a studio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>filled with light and color, where, in violet velvet
blouse, and cap upon his poetic locks, worked and
smoked the master of Italian art.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is my parteekler fren—the Baroness Von
Eulaw, Señor Fillipo,” and they hurried on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the suite, they first entered the dressing
room. It was plainly finished in French gray, with
gold and blue enamel, the same colors repeated in
drapery and cushions. But one piece attracted particular
attention. It was an alabaster fountain, the
elaborate accessories half concealing a full-sized bust
of Morning, the identity of which could not be mistaken.
It was exquisitely chiseled, and falling jets,
and icy foam, and cascades like cobwebs, built up
masses of soft, misty whiteness, shutting back all
save an incidental glimpse of outline, and thickening
by contrast the boldness of the water plants at the
base.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A very pretty conceit,” said the baroness, approvingly.
“Who is the designer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me,” said the señorita, coldly, leading the way
to the main chamber, to which apartment Murella
carried the key. Unlocking the door, the baroness
had scarcely time to take in the mute, indescribable
effects of the auroral tints on the walls, stippled and
faded into thinnest ether, with its golden sky overspread
with winged cherubs in high relief, laid in
tints such as are only painted on angels, when the
baron’s party were heard approaching. One thing,
however, had struck the baroness, even at a cursory
glance. The dust lay thick and undisturbed over
all the furniture of the room. A superb curtain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>corn-colored brocade hung over one end of the apartment,
which also showed signs of not having been
disturbed at least for a term of many months. A
gesture of impatience was made by Murella as she
spoke, in an irascible tone of voice, “What for a he
bring a they here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the party, following their guide, entered,
expressing surprise at finding the ladies had preceded
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron at once walked over and engaged their
pretty hostess in conversation, laughing genuinely at
her piquant expressions and unworldly-wise ways,
while Morning talked about some irrelevant thing
with Miss Winters, and the rest of the company sauntered
to the remoter quarters of the apartments. Mrs.
Thornton, however, coveted a view behind the maize
curtain, and to this end plied the major-domo with
such blandishments as were at her command, and using
vigorously the little Spanish she possessed. The
Spaniard turned to look for the señorita—she had
momentarily disappeared with the baron—and he
flung aside the fatal curtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>There, in a regal frame, in a painting by the famous
hand of Prince Fillipo Colonna, master of arts in the
Royal Academy at Rome, appeared two full-sized
figures. They were those of David Morning and
Señorita Gonzales. It was an interior of an adobe
house. The saints upon the mud walls, with rosaries
suspended beneath them, and the crude decorations
about the fireplace, with the hammocks in the shadow
were dimly visible. Light came in through a low
window, and fell upon the white face of Morning, just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>tinged with returning health. One hand held suspended
a pencil, while with the other, just discernible
from out the shadows, he clasped the girlish figure of
Murella Gonzales.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a master work of art, and more than condoned
all malicious or vain intent on the part of the
author. The expression upon Morning’s face was
one of placid amusement, while that upon the girl’s
was anxious and arch, questioning and trusting, open,
yet elusive, like the mimosa growing sturdily from
the potted earth in the rude casement, which receded
at a sound of the human voice. The noble artist had
evidently caught an inspiration from the local color—filtrated
through the hot brain of the lovely señorita—and
had touched the face of Morning with the light of
his lovely companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morning had just crossed over to catch a word
with the baroness when the tableau was unveiled.
Her whitening face frightened him, and he looked
quickly over her shoulder at the picture. At the
same moment a piercing shriek, and Señorita Murella
rushed wildly down the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Madre de Dios!</span></i>” she yelled. “What a you do
that a for?” and she menaced the poor Spaniard with
her small fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was I, it was I,” pleaded Mrs. Thornton.
“Don’t blame him.” But Murella turned from her
with high scorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fool, I will kill a him,” she shrieked, again turning
to the place where the man had stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Señor Don Manuel Jose Maria Ignacio Cervantes
Alvarado, knowing something of the temper of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>his niece, had attended not upon the order of his going,
but slipped away, and in his place stood Morning.
For one brief moment Murella looked at him,
then, drawing a pearl-handled stiletto from beneath
her girdle, she gashed and stabbed the unconscious
canvas in twice a dozen places, crying all the time,
“Take a that, and a that, and a that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning thought that his time had come, but he
manfully stood his ground, secretly smiling at the
bloodless assassination, until, exhausted, Murella fell
upon the carpet in a genuine hysterical rage. After
a moment he lifted her to her feet, placed her hand
within his arm, and led her unresistingly from the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour later she stood at the boathouse, leaning
upon the arm of Prince Fillipo, and gayly waving an
adieu to the party, Morning among them; then, with
the artist’s arm about her waist, they slowly returned
up the terrace steps, while the decorated steamer
went out of sight around the cove.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the Baroness Von Eulaw guessed now who it
was that had made the pin holes in her eyes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The Congress of 1892 builded even better than it
knew, when it dropped partisan prejudices, and arose
superior to local fetterings, and, in a truly national
spirit, secured for the United States of America dominion
of the seas and control of the commerce of the
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Act of Congress which guaranteed the payment
of five per cent bonds of the Nicaragua Canal
Company to the extent of $100,000,000, and which
provided that the canal tolls upon American ships
should never be more than two-thirds the amount
charged the vessels of other nations, enabled the company
to construct the canal with unexpected rapidity,
without calling upon the United States for a dollar of
the guaranty, while, more than any subsidy or favorable
mail contract, it aided to place the Stars and
Stripes at the mastheads of the vast fleet of ships and
steamers which, upon the completion of the canal in
the autumn of 1895, began to pass between the Atlantic
and the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>The local traffic developed by the canal proved
something phenomenal. Early in the history of its construction
it became generally known that the country,
for hundreds of miles about Lake Nicaragua, was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>an unhealthy tropical jungle, but an elevated, breezy
table-land, environed and divided by snow-clad mountains,
with an average temperature only a few degrees
warmer than that of California, and with a much more
even distribution of rainfall.</p>

<p class='c007'>A knowledge of these advantages was followed by
a large incursion of American settlers. There is perhaps
no product of field or forest more profitable
than the coffee plant. Steadily the demand for the
fragrant berry is upon the increase, while, beside having
few enemies in the insect world, the area within
which coffee can be advantageously grown is very
limited. While the coffee plant does not require
an exceptionally hot climate, it will not thrive where
frost is a possibility. The hill slopes and table-lands of
Nicaragua were found to be peculiarly adapted for its
growth, and thousands of acres of young plantations
were already thriving where for centuries only wild
grasses had waved. Short lines of railroad, centering
on Lake Nicaragua, and running in every direction,
had made accessible a large extent of country. The
scream of the gang saw was heard amid forests of dyewoods,
rosewood, and mahogany. Mines of gold, silver,
copper, iron, and coal were opened. Cotton,
sugar, and indigo plantations were developed, and
Millerville, on Lake Nicaragua, when the war ships
passed through the canal to attend David Morning’s
dynamic exposition, was already a city of fifty thousand
people, provided with electric lights and cable
roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages to the people of the United States
of the completed Nicaragua Ship Canal were almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>incalculable. The freight-carrying business of the
world between the east coast of Asia and Europe
was rapidly transferred to American bottoms. The
iron manufacturers of Tennessee, Alabama, and
Georgia were given an opportunity, previously denied
them, of marketing the product of their furnaces and
foundries on the Pacific Coast of North America. The
dwellers in the Mississippi Valley could now send their
cotton, meats, and manufactures to trans-Pacific and
Antipodean markets, and California redwood and
Puget Sound fir and cedar lumber could be sent over
all the Northwest.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Pacific Coast the canal added twenty-five
per cent to the productive value of every acre of grain
and timber land. The cost of sacking, and half the
cost of transporting wheat was saved to the farmer,
and the freight upon all machinery and heavy goods
brought from the East was greatly lessened.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Puget Sound the construction of a ship canal,
costing less than $2,000,000, connecting the fresh
waters of Lake Washington with the salt water in
Elliott Bay, gave to Seattle such facilities for warehousing,
loading, and dry-docking, and such independence
of tides and teredos, that a commercial
rival of San Francisco was spreading over the hills of
the fir-fringed Queen of the New Mediterranean, while
at the extreme southwestern corner of the republic
the city of bay and climate—San Diego—was rapidly
regaining the population and prestige which temporarily
slipped from her grasp at the subsiding of the
boom which, during 1886 and 1887, enkindled the
imagination, and beguiled the judgment, and encrazed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>with the fever of speculation, the people of Southern
California.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even during the dull times which annihilated so
many promising fortunes in Southern California, the
attractions of Coronado Beach were sufficient to secure
for it exemption from the dire distress which overtook
other localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company owning this enterprise successfully
defied not only a bursted boom but the very forces of
nature, for they riprapped the beach in front of their
hotel, and baffled the Pacific Ocean, which, after
gnawing up the lawn and shrubbery which fronted its
restless waters, had set its foam-capped legions at work
to undermine the foundations of the great ballroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parks, avenues, and streets were improved, museums
and gardens developed, and races and hops
and fishing and boating parties encouraged. Excursions
from neighboring cities were organized, the East
was flooded with pamphlets praising Coronado, and
the pleasure-loving and health-seeking world was in
every way reminded that in this land of rare delights
it could pick ripe oranges and enjoy surf bathing in
midwinter, while Boston was shivering and New York
swept with blizzards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The band at the hotel was kept playing every day
at luncheon and dinner, and it discoursed sweet music
in the ballroom regularly upon hop nights to auditors,
who found—as all people can find—more of the physical
comforts and delights of life at Coronado Beach
than anywhere else in the world, for nowhere else is
there such music in the sea, such balm in the air,
such sunshine, and fragrance, and healing, and rest.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The faith and patience of the owner of the great
hotel were, in the end, rewarded. Month by month
and year by year did the numbers of his guests increase,
until, in 1895, the capacity of the house was
more than doubled, by the addition of a building
something over a quarter of a mile in length, and the
great hotel could now accommodate quite two thousand
guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Morning selected Coronado Beach for his
dynamic experiments, and, with some difficulty, chartered
the entire hotel for one month, during which
time it was reserved exclusively for his guests. He
also leased the northerly end of the Coronado Beach
peninsula for the construction and equipment of his
air ship, and for a laboratory for the manufacture of
potentite.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real Coronado Islands are within the territorial
jurisdiction of Mexico, situated about sixteen miles
south and west from San Diego Bay, and were, except
in cloudy weather, distinctly visible from Coronado
Beach. Irregular and ragged masses of red sandstone
a few thousand acres in extent towered to a height of
several hundred feet above the ocean, faintly staining
the horizon with patches of blue, resembling an unfinished
sky in water color.</p>

<p class='c007'>These islands were destitute of water and vegetation,
and never inhabited save by a few laborers who
were engaged in quarrying rock there, and Morning
found no difficulty in purchasing them from their owners,
and removing all the occupants.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the northern end of the Coronado Beach peninsula,
Morning caused to be erected a laboratory for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the manufacture of potentite, with which to load the
steel shells to be carried by the air ship. This new
dynamic force, or, rather, storehouse of force, consisted
of a combination of explosive gelatine with fulminate
of mercury, and possessed a power equal to
thirteen hundred tons to the square inch, or sixty
times that of common blasting gunpowder, and nine
times that of dynamite, and fifty pounds of it properly
directed would sink any ironclad afloat. It is quite
safe for manipulation, because it is unexplosive, except
when brought in contact with a chemical substance—also
non-explosive except by contact—which
is only added immediately before using.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Petrel</em>, the air ship used at the dynamic exposition,
was built by the Mount Carmel Aeronautic
Company at their works in Chicago, and sent by rail
in sections to Coronado Beach, where she was put together.
She was cigar-shaped, one hundred feet in
length and twenty feet in diameter, and was built of
butternut—the toughest of the light woods. Her
engines, with their fans and propellers, as well as the
gas generator and tank for benzine, were all constructed
of tempered aluminum, made by the new Kentucky
process, at a cost of only eight cents per pound.
Being stronger and tougher than the finest steel, and
only one-third the weight of that metal, aluminum was
especially adapted for the construction of air ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>The machinery of the <em>Petrel</em> was propelled by a
gas generated from benzine. The fluid was carried
in an air-tight aluminum tank, from which it passed,
drop by drop, to the generator. This gas, almost as
powerful as the vibratory ether discovered by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Keely, was much safer because more certainly controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Petrel</em>, with all her machinery in place, with
two tons of benzine in her tanks, and ten men on
board of her supplied with sufficient water and food
for use for fifteen days, weighed but ten tons, and the
force generated from two tons of benzine was sufficient
to lift her, with a freight of ten tons more, to a
height of five thousand or even ten thousand feet,
and, without any aid from her folding aluminum parachute,
was able to maintain her there for a fortnight,
at a speed—in a still atmosphere—of fifty miles per
hour. No balloon was attached to the <em>Petrel</em>, as she
relied entirely upon her paddles and wings both for
propulsion and as a means of maintaining herself in
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was constructed upon the principle of aerial
navigation furnished by the wild goose. That bird
maintains himself in the ether during a flight of hundreds
of miles without a rest, simply because his
strength, or muscular power, is greater, in proportion
to his weight, than that of creatures who walk upon
the ground. Man could always have constructed
wings of silk and bamboo which would have enabled
him to fly if he had only possessed the strength to
flap his wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aerial navigation never presented any other problem
than that of procuring power without weight.
Once able to obtain the power of a ten-horse engine,
with a weight, including machinery, of less than one
ton, one might fly all over the world, and, by taking
advantage of the air currents, a knowledge of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>will soon be gained, fly at a speed of fifty or even one
hundred miles an hour. The recent discovery of the
immense power of a gas which it is possible to generate
from benzine without the use of fuel, has made the
air as available for the purposes of rapid transit by
man as the ocean or the land. The great cost of
locomotion by this means will doubtless prevent its
use for the transportation of freight, or, indeed, of passengers,
except for those who can afford the luxury,
and for them it will supplant all other methods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Petrel</em> was provided with the new patent condensed
fuel, one pound of which for cooking and
heating purposes is equal to ten pounds of coal. She
was furnished with parachutes made of thin sheets of
aluminum closely folded one above the other. These,
when not in use, formed an awning or canopy over
her deck, while, in case of accident, they could, by
pulling a convenient lever, be instantly spread over
an area large enough to insure her a gradual and safe
descent, and should such descent be into the water,
she was so constructed as to float as buoyantly as a
cork upon its surface, while, by lessening the number
of revolutions per minute of her aluminum propellers,
they could be used as paddles for her propulsion
through the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The freight of the <em>Petrel</em> consisted of two hundred
shells of potentite, weighing one hundred pounds
each, and the result to the Coronodo Islands of their
falling upon it from a height of a mile or more, was
predicted long in advance of the experiment. “If,”
it was said, “fifty pounds of this explosive will destroy
an ironclad, what will twenty thousand pounds of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>do to an island of rock? What would a dozen <em>Petrels</em>
accomplish, hurling two hundred and forty thousand
pounds of it upon an army, a city, or an enemy’s
fortress?”</p>

<p class='c007'>They could level Gibraltar with the sea; they could
extirpate an army of a million men; they could obliterate
London or Berlin or New York from the face of
the earth. A fleet of a hundred <em>Petrels</em> could ascend
from New York, cross the Atlantic in three days, destroy
every city in the United Kingdom in six hours,
and, leaving England a mass of ruins, with two-thirds
of her people slain, return in three days to New York,
with unused power enough to go to San Francisco
and back without descending.</p>

<p class='c007'>England, or any other nation, could likewise destroy
America, for neither aerial navigation nor the
manufacture of potentite are secrets locked in any
one man’s brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Mr. Morning’s dynamic exposition,” it was
said, “shall fulfill its promise, he can, if he chooses,
as the possessor of so complete an air ship and so
powerful an explosive, be the ruler of the world.
Emperors and Parliaments must, for the time, be the
subjects of the man who can destroy cities and camps,
and who can make such changes in the map of the
world as he may choose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the experiment this day to be made at Coronado,”
said the President of the United States, “shall
be successful, armies may as well be disbanded, for
there can be no more war, and governments all over
the world must, henceforth, rest upon the consent of
the governed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Before sending the <em>Petrel</em> upon her mission, an examination
of the territory to be devastated was in
order, and the Hotel del Coronado was nearly emptied
of its guests, for the <em>Charleston</em>, the <em>Warspite</em>, and
the <em>Wilhelm II.</em>, steamed away to the Coronado Islands,
where the American, British, German, French,
Russian, Italian, Mexican, and Brazilian engineers,
with their assistants, landed, took measurements and
altitudes, and a number of photographic views, and
examined the islands thoroughly, verifying the accuracy
of the topographical maps and profile models
in clay previously made by engineers employed by
Morning. It was projected to make another survey
and set of maps after the potentite had done its work,
so as to preserve an accurate and unimpeachable
record of the result of what our hero modestly called
his “experiment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The vessels returned to their moorings about three
o’clock in the afternoon of the first day of the exposition,
in ample time for their passengers and officers
to attend the dinner given by Morning that evening
to his royal and imperial majesty Edward the Seventh,
king of Great Britain and emperor of India. This
sagacious prince, rightly conceiving that the dynamic
exposition of citizen David Morning was likely to be
the preliminary of an entire change in the methods of
government, if not in the governments themselves,
of the civilized world, determined to head in person
the British delegation, which was brought on the <em>Warspite</em>
from Vancouver to San Diego.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner in which King Edward has impressed
the American people may be deduced from a remark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>made at the dinner by a shrewd observer and leading
citizen of San Diego.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That king,” said he, “is a dandy. He is credited
with being the cleverest and most adroit politician in
England, and I believe it, or he could never have
steered his canoe out of that baccarat whirlpool. If
Dave Morning’s dynamics should sort of blow him
out of a job at home, let him come over here, and in
one year I will back him at long odds to get the nomination
for the best office in the county from either the
Democratic or Republican convention, and, maybe,
from both. What a roaring team he and Jack Dodge
and Sam Davis would make for a county canvass!
Jack to do the fiddling and dancing, Sam the all-around
lying, and Edward the hand shaking and the
setting ’em up for the boys!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ample gardens of San Diego, San Bernardino,
Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara were stripped for the
decoration of the banquet hall. All day flowers were
arriving by the train load, and several hundred floral
artists were at work in the great dining room. The
effect was surpassingly beautiful. Suspended from
the great dome by ropes of smilax was a gigantic
figure of Peace, wrought in white calla lilies, bearing
in her right hand a branch from an olive tree, while
her left held to her lips a trumpet of yellow jasmine.
On the walls the arms of all nations were wrought in
camellias, carnations, fleur-de-lis, and roses of every
hue. The music and the menu were both incomparable,
and, in accordance with the later and better
practice of great dinners, formal speech making was
altogether dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The next morning the shores of Coronado Beach
were black with people, and in the great hotel every
piazza and window facing southward or westward was
occupied. There was a light breeze blowing from
the north as the <em>Petrel</em> left her berth and rapidly
mounted in the air to a height of seven thousand feet,
which altitude she achieved with her fans in seven
minutes’ time. She then put her propellers in motion
and was soon a mere speck against the cloudless sky,
scarcely discernible by the most powerful glasses.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though out of sight she soon made her existence
and her work known to the multitude. In
thirty-five minutes from the time she left her berth,
she had compassed a mile and a half in height and
sixteen miles of distance and was hovering over Coronado
Islands. In twenty minutes more six men on
board of her had thrown over the two hundred potentite
shells, and in half an hour thereafter the aerial
wonder was again resting quietly on the peninsula.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a clear day, and the islands were distinctly
visible. Sight travels more swiftly than sound, and
before any noise was heard, the immense mass of
rock, crown shaped, from which the islands take their
name, was seen by the gazers on the beach to leap
from its place and fall into the sea. Other masses in
swift succession followed; then came roars of sound,
as if heaven and earth were coming together; roars
of sound which rattled the doors and casements of the
hotel as if shaken with a high wind. For twenty
minutes this awe-inspiring exhibition continued, and
when the tremendous cannonading ceased, the Coronada
Islands—in the form in which they had previously
existed—were no more.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>The work of resurveying and making new topographical
maps was subsequently performed, as a
part of the duty of those connected with the dynamic
exposition, but it needed no measurements to demonstrate
the awful power of the potentite. An area of
solid rock a mile square was rent into fragments for
a depth of one hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many improvements in machinery and management
were suggested to the officers of the <em>Petrel</em>, but
the experiment was conceded by all the great engineers
who witnessed it, to be so completely successful
as to practically eliminate land warfare from the future
of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is fortunate,” said the Marquis of Salisbury,
who was one of the British delegation—“it is fortunate
that the manufacture of even a small quantity of
potentite requires months of time, great skill, and a
costly and extensive laboratory, so that it will be not
impracticable to prevent its preparation by private
persons. But given a piece of land anywhere in the
civilized world large enough to permit of the building
of air ships and the manufacture of potentite, and
sufficiently defended to afford to its garrison three
months’ time in which to perfect the making of that
explosive, and any power, however insignificant, could,
with a hundred air ships, destroy in three days all the
great cities in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As it now appears,” continued the Marquis, “this
method of warfare would not be so available against a
moving object on the sea, such as a war ship. But if
the submarine torpedo boat, whose operations we are
to witness to-morrow, shall be anything nearly as effective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>as Mr. Morning’s air ship, it seems to me that a
convention of civilized powers to adjust international
relations and provide for a Congress and Court of
Nations, to which all international differences must be
submitted, will be an absolute necessity in the future,”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how would the decrees of such a court be
enforced, your lordship,” inquired Prince Bismarck,
who was listening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the only aerial war vessels equipped with potentite
which the allied nations would suffer to exist,
your highness, and which vessels would be subject to
the orders of the Court of Nations. If any nation refused
to obey such decree, it could be disciplined, and
if any nation attempted to put a potentite air ship under
way, it would be necessary, in self-defense, for the
allied powers, after adequate warning, to extirpate the
offending parties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Might not a potentite air ship be secretly fitted
out, your lordship?” asked the prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly,” replied the Marquis, “for, with the aid
of a corps of observation air ships, and of international
detectives in every center of population, the world,
both savage and civilized, could be adequately policed
at a very small cost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what, in your lordship’s opinion, will be
the condition in or before the Congress of Nations, of
a people who desire separate government and who
have been unable to obtain it?” said Mr. Michael
Davitt, who was standing by.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Marquis looked the Irishman squarely in the
eye and replied slowly: “I think it will be quite out
of the power of any government to retain by force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>under its rule any considerable number of people,
who, with or without, a grievance, are practically
unanimous for a separate government. The Congress
of Nations will, or at least ought to, require that any
people seeking separation shall be nearly unanimous.
But do you think, Mr. Davitt, to be candid, that the
people of Ulster and the people of Galway would ever
be brought to agree to any proposition on earth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Begorra, your lordship, if you don’t mind me
takin’ the answer to your question out of the mouth
of Misther Davitt,” said the Honorable Bellew McCafferty,
Home Rule member from Mayo—“begorra,
there’s one great principle upon which Oireland is,
and ever will be, united. Catholic and Protestant, Fardowner
and Corkonian, Priest and Peeler are all
heart and soul agreed”—</p>

<p class='c007'>“To do what?” queried his lordship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” replied the McCafferty, “never to pay
any rint.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The <em>Siva</em> steamed out of San Diego harbor at nine
o’clock on an April morning in the year 1896, carrying
as passengers the naval and ordnance officers
commissioned by the various European and American
governments to examine and report upon the
result of the dynamic exposition. The civil and
diplomatic representatives were apportioned among the
different members of the fleet, which had gathered
from the Pacific squadrons of every naval power in
the world, and was now lying in San Diego Bay. The
success of the air ship the day before in almost obliterating
the Coronado Islands, filled every mind with
eager anticipation of the results likely to be achieved
by the torpedo boats, and there was an especial pressure
for places on board the <em>Siva</em>, which carried the
novel engines of destruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Siva</em> had been built at the Union Iron Works
in San Francisco, from plans and models furnished by
engineers employed by Morning, and no expense had
been spared to make her the largest, swiftest, and
best-appointed war vessel afloat. Indeed, every other
consideration had been sacrificed to speed, and, as a
result, a ship was constructed of ten thousand tons’ burden,
drawing but twenty-one feet of water when fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>loaded, and able, when under a full head of steam, to
make twenty-six knots an hour. Relying upon her
speed to keep out of range of the guns of an enemy,
and intended rather for a carrier of torpedo boats than
a war vessel, she was, for her size, neither heavily
armed nor heavily armored, yet she was covered with
steel plates of sufficient thickness to resist the largest
ordnance, and she was equipped with rifled cannon
and pneumatic dynamite guns, equal in size and range
to any constructed. Her cost was $8,000,000, and
it was Morning’s avowed intention to present her to
the alliance of nations which he expected would result
from the dynamic exposition. The <em>Siva</em> rode the
seas like a gull, and was as graceful and beautiful as
a swan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forward of her engines the hull of the vessel was
devoted to accommodations for housing, launching,
and rehousing the two torpedo boats, the <em>Etna</em> and
<em>Stromboli</em>. Each of these was cigar-shaped, one hundred
feet in length and twenty feet in diameter. They
were built of steel, with an inner and outer shell. The
admission of water between these shells would cause
the submersion of the boat to any depth required for
the purposes of destroying an enemy, while by the
expulsion of water they were enabled to ascend to the
surface. In the inner shell was an electric engine,
with sufficient power stored in its dynamos to propel
the boat under water at a speed of twenty-five miles
an hour for a period of five hours. Enough compressed
air was stored in steel tanks to supply the
needs of ten men for eight hours, and the <em>Etna</em> had,
on several occasions, as a test, remained submerged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>with her crew for four hours without coming to the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The construction of torpedo boats for harbor defense
was no longer a novelty, but this was the first
attempt made to demonstrate that a submarine torpedo
vessel could be used on the high seas to overtake
and destroy a flying enemy. The <em>Etna</em> and the
<em>Stromboli</em> each carried one hundred shells, each shell
being loaded with five hundred pounds of potentite.
Chain cradles for holding these shells were suspended
to huge fans of finely-tempered steel, shaped like
pincers, and the machinery for fastening one or more
of these cradles to the bottom of the vessel it was intended
to destroy was both simple and ingenious, as
were the arrangements for exploding them when
fastened. A fuse or wire attached to a steamer running
away at the rate of a mile in three minutes would
have been impracticable, and the inventor had therefore
arranged a time or clockwork cap, which could
be set to explode at any given number of minutes
from the time the shell should be fastened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Siva</em>, containing Mr. Morning, the foreign
engineers, and the ordnance officers of the American
Navy detailed for the service, left her moorings at
nine o’clock and steamed down the bay, followed by
the <em>Warspite</em>, flying the British flag, the French corvette
<em>Garronne</em>, the Russian frigate <em>Tsar</em>, the Italian
ironclad <em>Victor Emanuel</em>, the Spanish ship <em>Pizarro</em>,
the Chilean man-of-war <em>Cero del Pasco</em>, the Swedish
sloop-of-war <em>Berdanotte</em>, the American iron batteries
<em>Charleston</em> and <em>San Francisco</em>, and the great German
steel war ship <em>Wilhelm II.</em> It was intended that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>latter vessel should follow the <em>Warspite</em>, but there was
some delay in getting her under way, and she was the
last in the naval procession, being followed only by
the <em>Esmeralda</em>—the vessel to be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the termination of the Chilean insurrection it
was found that the <em>Esmeralda</em>—the war ship controlled
by the insurgents—was, though not unseaworthy, yet
too badly damaged by a contest with gunboats to be
serviceable for the purposes for which she was constructed,
and she was, therefore, sold by the Chilean
Government to Mr. Morning for $1,000,000—something
less than one-third her cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>He purchased her for use as a transport in connection
with the construction of the Nicaragua Canal,
in which he was interested, and he now devoted her
to destruction, as a test of the power of the new explosive,
and the efficiency of the submarine torpedo
boats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Esmeralda</em> was an ironclad steamer of the
largest size, capable of a speed of twenty miles an
hour. She was armored with steel plates, and in every
way staunch. On this occasion she carried only sufficient
force to navigate her, and she towed a large
steam launch, into which her crew would be transferred
and conveyed to a place of safety so soon as
the torpedoes should be fastened to her. Two lifeboats
were also swung, ready for launching in case of
accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baron Von Eulaw had been indulging the previous
night in deep potations, and was, consequently, so belated
that the carriage containing the baroness and
himself did not reach the Coronado wharf until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><em>Siva</em> had steamed away, and was being followed by
the other vessels in the order described. The launches
and small steamers, with the guests apportioned among
the different vessels of the fleet, had also left the wharf,
and two-thirds of the vessels which were to accompany
the <em>Siva</em>, with their steam up and whistles blowing,
were impatiently awaking the signal to move,
and were uneasily churning into a foam the placid
waters of the harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hastily summoning a boat lying at the wharf, the
baron escorted the baroness on board, and, seating
himself beside her, directed the crew to row for “that
ship,” pointing to the <em>Esmeralda</em>. It will never be
known whether this direction was the result of accident
or design, for the <em>Esmeralda</em>, in size and general
appearance, strongly resembled the <em>Wilhelm II.</em>, which
was anchored just ahead of her in the stream, and it
was the <em>Wilhelm II.</em> to which the Baron Von Eulaw,
as one of the representatives of the German Empire,
had been assigned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the <em>Esmeralda</em>, however, the anchor of
which was then being hoisted, the baron was politely
informed by the officer in charge of the deck that no
arrangements had been made to receive guests on
board the vessel, as she was destined to destruction.
The baron, with real or affected dismay, remarked
that the <em>Wilhelm II.</em> was already under way; that it
would be impossible for him now to gain her deck,
and, unless permitted to board the <em>Esmeralda</em>, and remain
upon her, they would lose altogether the great
spectacle they had, by designation of his imperial
majesty  Wilhelm II., come all the way from Berlin
to San Diego to attend.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>He would be in lasting disgrace at home if compelled
to admit that, through his own negligence and
error, he had not witnessed the destruction of the
<em>Esmeralda</em> at all. Might not the baroness and himself,
under the circumstances, be suffered to trespass upon
the hospitalities of the officers of the <em>Esmeralda</em> until
the time came for abandoning the vessel, when they
could join the officers and crew on the steam launch,
and be placed on board the <em>Wilhelm II.</em>, or one of the
other vessels of the fleet, or return on the launch to
San Diego, as might be most convenient?</p>

<p class='c007'>With some hesitation, the deck officer of the <em>Esmeralda</em>,
after brief consultation with his superior,
consented to the request of Von Eulaw, and, apologizing
for the condition of the cabin, which, in anticipation
of the destruction of the vessel, had been stripped
of everything save the standing furniture and a few
chairs, he invited them to make themselves as comfortable
as circumstances would permit.</p>

<p class='c007'>With salvos of cannon and music of bands, the
gaily-decked fleet sped out to sea. Through the
narrow channel they steamed, past Point Loma, with
brow of purple and feet of foam. When they reached
the open sea, they spread out in line abreast, the <em>Siva</em>
taking a position on the extreme north, and slackening
her speed a little so as to accommodate it to that
of her companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the scene of the proposed experiment,
sixteen miles west of San Diego bar, the speed of all
the vessels was slackened so as to afford only steerage
way, and the <em>Esmeralda</em> was signaled to leave her
position next the <em>Siva</em>, and steam away at full speed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>to the north. Simultaneously with this order, the
hatches on the <em>Siva</em> were opened, chains and ropes
tightened, the vast power of the engines applied, and
the <em>Stromboli</em>, with her crew and cargo in place, was
lifted from the hold of the <em>Siva</em>, swung over the side,
and launched in the ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was four minutes from the time the whistle
sounded until the launch of the <em>Stromboli</em>, and in the
meantime the <em>Esmeralda</em> steamed quite one mile
away. The <em>Siva</em> was a few hundred yards ahead of
the other vessels, and the <em>Stromboli</em> was launched
form her port side, so that the launch was witnessed
by those who thronged the starboard side of the
other vessels. The entire fleet then resumed its
former rate of speed, and the distance between it and
the <em>Esmeralda</em> was soon placed at one mile, at which
it was subsequently maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Stromboli</em> glided away for a minute on the surface
of the sea, and then, admitting water to the space
between her steel shells, rapidly sank to a depth of
forty feet. The <em>Esmeralda</em> was still at full speed, and
making twenty knots an hour, but the <em>Stromboli</em> was
pushing her way under the sea, propelled by her
powerful electric engines, at the rate of twenty-five
knots an hour, and in fifteen minutes had overtaken
the doomed vessel, and was preparing to make fast
the torpedo which should destroy her.</p>

<p class='c007'>One pair of great steel claws, holding a chain basket
containing five hundred pounds of potentite set
by clockwork to explode in sixty minutes, was, by
the power of the electric engine, raised above the
cigar-shaped steel monster gliding through the cool,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>quiet waters, and driven through the plates of the
<em>Esmeralda</em>, just forward of the stern of that vessel.
A second was placed amidship, and a third near the
bow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper deck of the <em>Stromboli</em> had a dozen plate-glass
openings, through which a number of powerful
electric lights illuminated the depths of the ocean,
and enabled the men in charge of the machinery to
direct with accuracy the work of fastening the torpedoes.
If it had been necessary, men in submarine
armor, fastened to steel arms projected from the
<em>Stromboli</em>, and supplied with air through rubber tubes,
could have been placed at work on the bottom of the
<em>Esmeralda</em>, and maintained there for hours, even
while she was coursing through the seas. But it was
not necessary to invoke this process, for, by the aid
of the ordinary machinery of the <em>Stromboli</em>, the three
great shells were fastened in twenty minutes’ time, and
the <em>Esmeralda</em> was proceeding on her journey with fifteen
hundred pounds of potentite fastened to her keel.
The officers and crew of the <em>Esmeralda</em> all subsequently
testified that this work was performed noiselessly
and without jar, or any evidence that it was
going forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>But had they possessed all knowledge, they could
not have prevented it. No rate of speed possible to
the doomed vessel would have enabled her to outrun
the speedier submarine torpedo boat, and no machinery
or appliance could have reached her under the
keel of the <em>Esmeralda</em>, or prevented her work, and
once the potentite shells were in place, it was beyond
the power of man to remove them, and no human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>skill could prevent the explosion taking place at the
appointed time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The introduction of this deadly force into naval
warfare was not intended to be unaccompanied with
some merciful provisions for preventing unnecessary
destruction of human life, and a code of signals had
been prepared for all naval powers, to be used whenever
a vessel was to be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Stromboli</em>, having performed her duty, glided
from under the keel of the <em>Esmeralda</em>, and, at a distance
of a few hundred yards, shot up a signal pipe
above the surface of the ocean, and with her electric
whistle shrieked through it a succession of signals that
were heard by the multitude upon the fleet a mile
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Submarine torpedo boat has been underneath
your keel,” said one short shriek, and one more prolonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fifteen hundred pounds of the most powerful explosive
known to science are fastened to you,” said
fifteen short shrieks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make ready to count your minutes of life,” said
one long and two short shrieks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In thirty-six minutes your ship will be hurled in
fragments into the air,” said thirty-six short shrieks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave your ship to her inevitable fate. Launch
your boats and save your lives. Your enemy will pick
you up and receive your honorable surrender,” said
one shriek, continued for five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Standing on the deck of the <em>Warspite</em>, King Edward
the Seventh looked at his watch. If in thirty-six
minutes the <em>Esmeralda</em> should sink beneath the waves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the navies of England, with those of all other powers,
would be as obsolete for the purposes of attack or
defense upon the high seas as the galleys of Cæsar,
or the barge of Cleopatra. Another Trafalgar would
be as impossible as another Actium. The little
<em>Stromboli</em> and <em>Etna</em>, carried in the hold of the <em>Siva</em>,
could destroy every ironclad afloat. The latter vessel,
with her immense speed, could keep out of range
of the enemy’s guns, and she could send forth the
torpedo boats and destroy ship after ship. She could
pick up the torpedo boats, recharge their storage batteries,
refit their magazines with potentite shells, and
their tanks with compressed air, and send them forth
again and proceed with such work of destruction until
not a ship should live on any sea, except by license
of the <em>Siva</em>, and subject to her rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>What revolutions and what changes would this
dynamic exposition not precipitate upon the mistress
of the seas? India would give her new emperor
the choice between walking out and being potentited
out, and Canada, and Australia, and every other colony,
would be taking leave. And Ireland—well, here
was a state of things! Ireland would have whatever
Davitt, and McCarthy, and Dillon should agree upon
asking, or else every British war ship would be blown
up, and every Irishman who could raise the money,
would try the effect of a balloon loaded with potentite,
upon his friends across the channel. Of course,
it was a game in which one could give blows as well
as take them, but that is a very unequal game between
an anarchist and a king. It looked as if King Edward
might be compelled to “rustle” to keep the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>British crown on his royal brow. It might be well to
look up a good cattle range in Colorado where he
and nephew William, with the Hapsburgs, the Bourbons,
and the Romanoffs might retire, should it be
necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the stores of the <em>Esmeralda</em> which had not
been sent ashore was a decanter of brandy, which the
baron found in the cabin, and to which he devoted
himself so assiduously that when the whistles sounded,
announcing that the torpedoes were fastened to the
ship, he was, from the combined effects of past and
present potations, in a condition closely bordering
upon delirium tremens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first officer proceeded to the cabin, where Von
Eulaw and the baroness had withdrawn, and, attempting
to open the door, found it locked. The voice of
the baroness in a pleading tone was heard, followed
by oaths and maniacal laughter from the baron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The torpedoes are fastened to us, and in thirty-four
minutes this ship will be in the air,” said the officer
through the closed door. “Our orders are to
leave the vessel ten minutes before the explosion.
You had better go on board of the launch at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so?” yelled the baron. “Well, we will
go into the air along with the ship, my American wife
and myself. My estates are all gone. The Queen of
Diamonds has seized them and given them to the
Jack of Spades. This earth has nothing more for me,
and we will take now a trip to the stars above.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The officer comprehended the situation in an instant.
“He has the jimjams, sure enough,” he muttered,
“Best way is to humor him.” “All right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>baron,” said he, in a conciliatory tone. “But you
don’t want your wife to go with you, you know. Open
the door and let her come with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, no!” said the maniac. “The Baroness Von
Eulaw will go to heaven along with her dear husband,
that she loves so much, so much!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam,” said the officer, “can you not unlock
the door? If not, I will have it broken down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” shrieked the baron, “she cannot unlock the
door, for I have thrown the key into the sea through
the window, and if anybody makes any trouble with
the door, I have a little pistol, and I will shoot first
my beloved American wife, and then the man at the
door, and at last myself, and we will all go to the skies
in one trip.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame,” said the officer, “is he armed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is, and will, I fear, do as he threatens,” replied
Ellen, with trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The situation is serious,” said the officer. “The
torpedoes won’t wait for us, and the crew will be getting
nervous. In fact, I am nervous myself,” added
the officer, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</span></i>. “Suppose one of those infernal
machines should go off ahead of time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave us, sir,” said the baroness. “If I can get
the pistol from him by persuasion, I will discharge it
as a signal, and you can then break down the door.
If I cannot do this, you must save yourselves without
us. It would be useless for you to jeopardize
your lives for us, for he will surely kill me, and will
probably shoot you if you attempt to force the door
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter there aft, Mr. Morton?”
shouted the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>“Dutch baron crazy drunk, sir. Has locked the
door, and swears he will be blown up with the ship.
Has a pistol, and will kill his wife if we try to force
the door, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get a rifle, Mr. Morton, and stand ready to shoot
him through the skylight. But I will first signal the
<em>Siva</em> for orders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Aye</em>, aye, sir,” said the first officer cheerily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something wrong on board the <em>Esmeralda</em>, sir;
she is signaling us,” said the first officer of the
<em>Siva</em> to the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning, who was conversing with a Russian admiral,
overheard the speaker and came forward to where
the signal officer—the code spread before him—had
just answered, “Ready to receive signal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little scarlet flag in the hand of the signal officer
on the foretop gallant yard of the <em>Esmeralda</em> rapidly
spelled out the message.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Baron Von Eulaw and wife came on board as we
were starting. He has delirium tremens, and is
locked in cabin with her. Refuses to board launch,
and threatens to shoot her if we break down door.
We can kill him with a rifle through the skylight.
We wait orders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The face of David Morning was white with the
whiteness of death, but, with a voice in which there
was scarcely a tremor, he addressed himself to the
commander of the <em>Siva</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain, how far are we from the <em>Esmeralda</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About a mile, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long will it be before the explosion?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Twenty-two minutes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>“Is there any way by which the torpedoes now fastened
to her can be removed, or their explosion prevented,
captain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None whatever, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain, signal the <em>Esmeralda</em> to have riflemen in
place, but not to shoot the baron unless he offers violence
to his wife. Signal her also to slacken speed
while we run down to her. Signal the fleet to slacken
speed, and fall behind. Get out a boat with crew to
put me on board the <em>Esmeralda</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a rapid fluttering of scarlet flags from
main and foretops, and the orders were obeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go with you, Mr. Morning,” said the captain
of the <em>Siva</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so will I, and I, and I,” came in chorus
from a dozen officers and guests who had remained
breathless auditors of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Morning quietly, “I will go alone. I
do not propose to risk a single one of these valuable
lives, or this ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning picked up a coil of light rope from where
it hung on a belaying pin, and descended into the
boat, which, with crew in place, was now suspended a
few feet from the water. “Captain,” said he, “as
soon as we are launched you will steam away with the
<em>Siva</em>, and rejoin the fleet: The steam launch towed
by the <em>Esmeralda</em> will be sufficient to provide for the
safety of all. Run us as close to the <em>Esmeralda</em> as
you can, captain, before you drop us,” and Morning
rapidly knotted a slip noose in the rope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clang! clang! clang! sounded the signal to reverse
the engines; the <em>Siva</em> glided alongside and within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>three hundred feet of the <em>Esmeralda</em>, and the boat
containing David Morning dropped gently into the
foaming water. Clang! again went the gong, and by
the time David Morning sprang up the ladder at the
companion-way of the <em>Esmeralda</em>, the <em>Siva</em> was half a
mile away.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the foot of Morning touched the deck of the
doomed vessel, it lacked thirteen minutes of the time
set for the explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the situation?” said Morning to the captain
of the <em>Esmeralda</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Through the skylight we can see that the baroness
has evidently abandoned all effort to move the
baron, and is on her knees in the corner, apparently
in prayer. The baron is walking up and down the
cabin floor flourishing a cocked revolver, and muttering
to himself. The first officer with three gunners,
each with a Winchester rifle, are at the skylight
with sites drawn on the baron, anxious to fire as soon
as they get the order, and six men with a piece of
timber are in place, ready to burst open the cabin
door. It is only twelve minutes to the blow-up, sir,
and the men are getting uneasy. Shall we shoot and
rescue the lady, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet, captain. Can you open the skylight
from above noiselessly?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do so at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his noosed rope coiled in hand, Morning approached
the skylight. Often in Colorado he had,
from love of sport, attended rodeos and learned the
trick of the lasso. His skill with it was the admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>of the cowboys. “Kin Dave Morning handle
a riata?” said one of his enthusiastic admirers to a
correspondent of an Eastern newspaper. “Well,
stranger, I should smile! Kin he? He kin throw
his lariat a matter of forty feet around any part of a
jumping steer, hoof or horn. He kin throw a bull
buffalo at the head of the herd. He kin make a
buckin’ broncho turn two somersaults, and land him
on head or heels, just as he likes. He kin stop a
jacksnipe on the wing if he don’t fly too high. Oh,
I’m talkin’ to ye, stranger! Often I’ve seen him,
when he felt right well, throw his little lasso across
the room of the big hotel at Trinidad, and smash a fly
on a window pane without breaking the glass. Oh,
you can laff, of course! I ain’t got nothin’ agin your
hilarity, but if any gentleman feels inclined to doubt
the entire truth of anything I’ve been a sayin’, or has
anything to say agin Dave Morning, either as a vaquero
or a man, he kin get his gun ready, for my
name is Buttermilk Bill from the San Juan Range.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Poising his improvised riata, Morning looked down
through the open skylight. The baron, attracted by
the shadow, stopped in his nervous walk and looked
up. As he did so the noose dropped over his head
and shoulders, and pinioned his arms to his side, and
he was thrown to the floor, while the cocked pistol he
held in his hand was harmlessly discharged. Like a
cat, Morning dropped from the skylight upon the
floor of the cabin, followed by the first officer and the
gunners, all of whom proceeded—none too tenderly—to
wrap and tie the rope around the arms and legs of
the baron.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>“Now, then,” sounded the voice of the second officer
outside the cabin door; “now, then, my hearties,
once, twice, thrice, and away!” and, with a crash, the
door flew from its hinges nearly across the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning half supported and half carried the baroness
to the launch, which was now lying alongside
with steam up, and they descended to the deck, followed
by the crew and officers of the <em>Esmeralda</em> and
the crew of the boat from the <em>Siva</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the baron,” said the baroness faintly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain looked at the first officer, who made
reply, “He is in the cabin, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have still five minutes if anybody chooses to
bring him aboard,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>And after a pause of a few seconds nobody stirred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ellen looked at Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Morning leaped upon the deck of the <em>Esmeralda</em>,
followed by the captain, first officer, and one of
the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In less than a minute the Baron Von Eulaw, writhing,
cursing, and foaming at the mouth, was deposited
on the deck of the launch, which steamed away rapidly
in a direction opposite to that taken by the doomed
vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were just two minutes to spare. The wheel
of the <em>Esmeralda</em> had been lashed so as to head her
away from the fleet. Her chief engineer was the last
man to leave the engine room, and just before he left,
he pulled the lever to increase her speed, so that in
the two minutes which passed after the steam launch
and the <em>Esmeralda</em> separated, they were quite a mile
apart.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Suddenly a dull sound like the throb of a great
muffled drum was heard. An immense arch of water
arose in air. Upon its summit was the <em>Esmeralda</em>,
broken into a dozen fragments, which writhed like
a python twisting in the agonies of death. For a
moment the cloven mail of the giant flashed and scintillated
in the sun, and then, with a sound of sucking
water—the death gurgle of those engulfed by the sea—each
fragment went out of sight forever, and great
billows of foam rolled over the spot where the mighty
ship went down.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Morning accompanied as far as Chicago the special
trains containing those of the European guests
whose official duties required their immediate departure,
but very many, including the Baron Von Eulaw
and his party, remained at Coronado.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a good deal of effort, the episode of the baron’s
conduct, and the circumstances of the rescue of his
wife and himself, were kept out of the press reports,
yet the affair was, nevertheless, one of those open secrets
with which many people enliven conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Thornton was, for once, disinclined to suffer
her admiration for a title to induce her to overlook
the homicidal freak of her son-in-law, and she urged
Ellen in vain to formally separate her life from that
of her husband. Possibly her appreciation of the fact
that Morning was now more renowed than any European
potentate, and outranked any king on earth, and
her comprehension of the further fact that he was still
deeply in love with her daughter, may have influenced
her counsel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moved by some impulse, which perhaps she could
not have explained to herself, she took occasion when
thanking Morning for saving her daughter’s life, to
confide to him the history of how Ellen’s marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>had been brought about, to which she added the story
of her married life, and concluded by pressing upon
him for perusal, a package of her daughter’s letters.
These Morning carried with him to Chicago, and their
reading induced him, after parting with his distinguished
guests, to hasten his return to Coronado,
where he was advised that the Von Eulaw party would
remain for some weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a delicious afternoon the baroness, with Mrs.
Thornton and Miss Winters, sat in the gallery overhanging
the old music hall on the sea. Although a
new and costlier edifice had been built, with improved
acoustics and elaborate design, the little gem at the
corner of the hotel, long washed by the waves and
threatened by the breakers, seemed still a favorite resort
for concert and afternoon recitals, and thither
came many who sought for a restful hour under the
eloquent discourse of the old white-haired professor’s
violin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a pity for the world,” said Miss Winters,
during a pause in the performance, “that so few are
able to look into the soul of Tolstoi’s labors. In one
of his chapters he expresses the epitome of all musical
sensations in half a dozen lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you are not referring to the ‘Kreutzer
Sonata,’ Miss Winters,” broke in Mrs. Thornton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Winters smiled rather than spoke reply. But
the baroness took greater liberty and rejoined rather
saucily, “The regular thing, dear mother, is to ask for
some palliative to remove the taste from your mouth
after the mention of the much-abused ‘Kreutzer
Sonata.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Mrs. Thornton replied with a look of high disdain
and much fluttering of ribbons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not punctilious, but I could not sit and listen
to a defense of that man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not defending him, though I might, especially
if he were my client,” laughed Miss Winters.
“I am only deploring that the world will not forgive
his truths nor forget his faults in the universal power
of his genius.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was well that the next on the programme was Beethoven’s
seventh symphony, and that the men strolled
in soon afterwards, for nothing is so prolific of enmities
as the subject of Tolstoi, unless it be that of tariff.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enchanting numbers were ended, and the ladies
left the hall, the men taking another direction.
At the foot of the stairway they were accosted by
David Morning, who, after a greeting, turned and
joined the baroness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did you return?” said she, looking full
into his bronzed face, and again at his traveling
clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only this moment. And how are you? and has
the baron entirely recovered?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Completely, I believe, and for me, one could not
be so ungrateful as to be ill in this place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust not,” replied Morning absently.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence for a moment, then, turning
shortly, and looking into the handsome face of the
baroness, he said, without calling her by name, but
earnestly, and it may be added a little peremptorily,
“I wish to have a few moments’ conversation with
you after dinner, if you will be good enough to consent.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>“For what purpose? When? Alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your first question let me answer later. Here,
under the palms, on the beach, anywhere, but alone,
certainly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Each question was superfluous, of course, but she
was gaining time. At length she answered slowly,
“I could wish you had not asked me for this meeting,
Mr. Morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am going away. Will you, knowing this,
still refuse?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will come,” she said after a pause. “We will
sit here upon the veranda, after eight. The others
are going, I believe, to look at the dancers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And, thanking her, he lifted his hat and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The halls were not ablaze on this night, for there is
not light enough in the world to coax the sullen
shadows from their lurking-places in a modern interior.
But the arches of heaven, albeit moonless,
were more obedient, and the electric scintillations
searched and filled every rood of ground with their
unwarm but willing light, or chased with exact pencil
the willful outlines of orange and oleander, or the
more tender ways of acanthus, pepper, and palm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning had wheeled a luxurious easy-chair alongside
of his veranda “shaker,” and sat with his hands
upon the upholstered back, waiting for the one woman
in the world to him, while the promenaders, in full
evening toilet, filed in pairs along the thronged corridors,
and the soft strains of “La Paloma” floated
down from the balcony and mingled with the plash
of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Engaged,” spoke Morning curtly, as a youthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>lord, accompanying the British delegation, attempted
to move the fanteuil aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beg pardon, I wish I were,” retorted the scion
of a noble house, striding away with the fair one upon
his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is hope for that fellow,” Morning muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I left the baron to be taken to his room by his
valet,” explained the baroness approaching. “He
is a little tired and nervous,” and she loosened the
lace about her throat impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” dryly, was the only comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said he might get around here before he retired.
I hope you would not mind, he is so very
capricious, you don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, I don’t mind, but if he comes I am going,
for I ‘don’t mind’ saying also I’ve had enough of
that fellow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness looked up with surprise, but Morning
went on excitedly:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know I ought not to say this to you, but I
must say it, and a great deal more, unless you stop
me! I say you are in deadly terror of that man, and
you hate him beside, as you ought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you—who told you this? Surely you
are assuming—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, pardon me, I am assuming nothing. I read
your letters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who gave you my letters?” asked the baroness
in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your mother urged them upon me, and I was
disloyal enough to read them, every line,” a little
triumphantly. He arose hastily and walked away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>for a few paces, drying and fanning his face with his
handkerchief, then, returning, he leaned upon the
back of her chair, and, dropping his voice, said huskily,
and with quite uncontrollable emotion:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ellen—let me call you so this once, it remains
with you whether I ever utter the name again—dear
Ellen, answer this from your own sweet lips, have you
a spark of love for that beas—man?” correcting himself
too late. “I know how capricious the heart of a
woman is, and perhaps—but no! take your time to
answer, only give me your word,” and he walked
swiftly away, and looked out on the sea, and saw the
waves beat their soft white arms upon the sands, then
returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman had turned to ashen paleness. The
ever-repeating and distributing electric light had forgotten
the delicate tints of her dainty gown, and the
color of her hair and brows, with the roses upon her
bosom, and only the waxen face, with its dark eyes
filled with glistening tears, uprose whiter than the
beams.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor heart!” said he, noting the quiver of the
sensitive mouth. “It ought not to be so difficult to
speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the tortured woman found voice:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“David Morning,” she said, in tremulous tones,
“I am not meaning to question your right to give
challenge to my despair, though, for reasons you can
understand, it is from you, more than from all the
world, I would have disguised it. You ask me if I
love that man? I answer, No, no, a thousand times
no! But my sense of obligation as his wife is as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>stronger than my hate as misery is stronger than the
social bars which contain it, and I deem it neither
noble nor just to utter complaints against one who is,
whatever may be said, my legal protector before the
world. I do not deny that I have suffered untold
agonies, but I may as well bear them in one cause as
another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I confess,” said Morning, with a manner suddenly
grown cold, “I do not fully understand you. You
speak of ‘obligations,’ and ‘social bars;’ you cannot
mean that you would deliberately sacrifice your
woman’s soul, with all its honor and its aims, to a life
of dishonor and deceit—for so I dare to name it—for
dread of the idle dictum of a malicious social scarecrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baroness winced, but quickly rallied, and, leaning
forward in her chair, so near that he caught the
perfume of the roses on her corsage, she replied:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! though I will say in passing that, whatever I
might do, no woman, be she termagant or angel, has
ever lived long enough to escape the opprobrium
arising from the poisonous effluvia of the divorce
courts! However, that is not the subject under discussion,
and my unhappy feet are placed upon more
tenable ground. I confess myself, then, not strong
enough to defy the convictions of a life given much—the
maturer portion, at least—to an examination of the
ethics of the question. And I resolutely affirm that,
in my own mind, I am convinced that to seek to evade
the results of my own deliberate action, would be sinful,
and in violation of my own conscientious perceptions—‘a
grieving of the Spirit,’ in the language of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>a very old author, and, therefore, a sin against the
Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it possible, thought Morning, forgetful for the
moment of the purpose that had brought him there,
that in this evening of the nineteenth century a cultivated
woman, herself the victim of a system fiendish
in its power to forge public opinion, and cruel as the
Inquisition, should have the courage thus to look her
awful destiny in the face tranquilly, and smilingly set
upon it the cold white seal of conscience? And for a
brief moment he wondered if she were a saint or a
lunatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he thought of the many shafts of argument
that might be let loose to pierce the diseased cuticle of
her morbid philosophy, but he had not the heart, or,
rather, he lacked entire faith in their efficacy, so he
sat silently counting his heart beats. Finally, taking
alarm at his protracted silence, she resumed:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not misunderstand me; I am not narrow
enough to convict, or egotist enough to try to convert,
others to my way of thinking; I only speak for
myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your missionary seed would fall upon stony ground
if you were so disposed,” he answered quickly,
almost rudely. “Ellen Thornton,” he continued,
ignoring the hateful title that seemed to have engulfed
her body and soul for all of him, “for thirteen years
fate has been circumventing our lives. I have heard
your name over seas as you have heard mine, familiar
to all but each other. I have loved you with hope
and without it. Great wealth has been my portion,
yet I would be a beggar to-night if you would but
share my crust with me, with love like mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Into the eyes of the woman, fierce with resolution
and despair, there came tears, half of pity, half of
joy—pity for his fate and hers, joy for that the love
she had deemed lost and gone from their lives was
here, tireless and strong as the sea, immortal and
sweet as the morning, and the voice of the man whose
head was bent near her own thrilled her with its
music.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During all the years of parting,” continued Morning,
“I have been neither despairing nor misanthropic,
but I knew that the passion of my life had glowed and
burned, and—as I thought—died to ashes upon the
altar whose goddess was the dark-eyed maiden whom
my young manhood adored. When, less than a fortnight
ago, I was able to deliver you from the awful
death that madman would have inflicted upon you,
my exultation had but one sting, that I had saved you
for another, and for such a fate; and then, in my
insane rage, I cursed myself that I had not let you
die under my dizzy eyes, and so have rounded my
despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have come near to you now, our paths have
crossed. O God, how I have waited for the hour!
and how can I let you go? If I do, our ways will
again diverge, and every remove will bring us farther
apart. Do you know what this means to me? It is the
dividing of my soul from my body, of my heart from my
brain; it means a galvanized life, a career of eviscerated
motives, a gibbering, masquerading existence, emasculate
of manly and fruitful purpose, a hopeless love”—and
his voice trembled and sank—“ashes and dust
and nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>The baroness listened with passion tearing at her
heart, while her white lips were fashioning word of
wise restraint. Could she trust herself to speak? She
envied in her soul the women she had known abroad,
women of convictions, with uncoddled consciences,
charming, virtuous women too, but without the monitor
to guide the wayward thought, a sky without a polar
star, a ship without a rudder, and then she recalled
the burning words of the man beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” said she at length, “that I owe you my
life, and, in the logic of natural sequence, I should give
back that which you won. But it is love’s sophistry,
and, in truth, perhaps for no better reason than
because I so much desire it, I dare not. One phase
of your argument pricks my conscience in turn. You
tell me that your usefulness must pay the penalty of
my decision. Unsay those words, I entreat you”—and
she leaned far toward him. “God has singled
you out for a great destiny. Fulfill it. You have the
world at your feet; let that suffice you for the present.
I do not ask you to forget me!”—and her lips grew
tremulous. “I should die if I thought you could.
But work on, as you have been doing, for the sake of
humanity, and wait heroically, as you have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait for what? for somebody to die?” broke in
Morning hotly. “For somebody to die, that is the
English of it. Most lives are made what they are by
some woman. She may be a mother, a sister not
likely. Since I received that long-lost letter—anathemas
upon that circular desk,” and he pounded
the “shaker” arm with his fist—“I have had but
one inspiration in my projects, one question always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>ringing in my ears,—‘What will she think of it?’ Now
I have found you only to hear from your own lips that
my life is a failure, and yours a moral suicide, which
I seem as helpless to prevent as I am to put a stay
upon yonder waves that lash themselves to spray upon
the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“David Morning,” and her voice was firm now,
“I think I owe it to you as well as myself to tell you,
even with the marriage ring upon my finger, that I
wish I were free from the yoke of this fateful marriage;
that if I could be delivered from the body of
this death, then could I mount with glad wings the
great height to which your love would raise me. But
I could have no weight of a crying conscience upon
my feet, no wail of wounded justice behind me, and
so I will bear it to the end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say, even with that marriage ring upon your
finger. What care I,” said he, rising and standing
before her, “for that circlet of gold upon your beautiful
hand? I know it is a mockery, so do you, and
but for it that hand might have been mine, and all
these years have been saved to love and the heart’s
gladness. What signifies the sanction of the law if
you have not the sanction of your own soul? I shall
not seek to dissuade you more, but one question I
will ask of you, and if wealth could buy words eloquent
enough to couch it in, I would surrender my
possessions and delve for it again, if need be, in the
depths of the earth. But truth is simple, and so I beg
of you to answer from your soul, and thereafter I will
do as you bid me. Do you love me, darling? do
you?” and he bent over her chair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>She lifted a face radiant with beautiful light.
“Dearest,” said she softly, and David Morning thrilled
with delight—“dearest, I am glad that this meeting
and this understanding have come to us just here,
where hundreds of eyes are upon us, for, if it were
otherwise, I should forget all else except my desire to
comfort you, and should place my arms about your
neck, and ask you to seal upon my lips your forgiveness
of me for all that I have made you suffer. God
help me, I do love you, and I never loved any other.
You are my hero, my darling, and my heart’s delight.
All these years I have loved you, until the hour of
death I shall love you, and beyond the gates I shall
love you forever, and forever more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a great sob came from the breast of David
Morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble man,” she continued, “you have accomplished
a great work in the world. God has selected
and armed you for the deliverance of his nations.
You have other and greater work to do. In the doing
it the luster of your shield shall never be tarnished,
as it would be were we to wrong another now.
Go forth, my hero, my life, and my darling; go forth
panoplied in your high manhood to your duty. In
spirit I shall be with you ever. I shall rejoice in your
mighty deeds. I shall live in your nobler thoughts.
Day and night, my beloved, will my soul dwell with
yours. Only in perfect honor and faith can I join you.
If the hour for such union shall ever be given to us on
earth, come to me and you will find me waiting. If
it come only in the other land, I shall still be waiting.
But here, my darling, my own, my heart’s solace,
here we must meet not again.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>And she placed her ungloved fingers in his.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man and the woman sat silently hand in hand.
The music floated out from the lighted ballroom,
where “the dancers were dancing in tune;” the sea
curled its beryl depths to crests of foam, and sounded
in musical monotones upon the beach which lay a
white line upon the edge of the dusk, and the old, old
world, the sorrowful, disappointing world, the weary
world, was as sweet and young as when the first dawns
were filtrated from chaotic mists.</p>

<p class='c007'>She broke the silence and withdrew her hand:
“Yonder comes the baron.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by,” said he, and he walked away into the
night, and as he reached the edge of the balcony overhanging
the beach, and felt the sting of the salt spray
in his eyes, he muttered something. It might have
been a good-night prayer, but it sounded like, “Damn
the baron.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The immediate cause of the baron’s death was hyperemia

to receive his remains, which will be embalmed for
transportation in state to Berlin, where they will be
interred with fitting pomp.</p>

<p class='c011'>The baroness, who to the last was devoted in her

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <span class='small'>“All’s well that ends well.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a lovely morning in June, in the year of our
Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, when a carriage
containing a red-headed and red-bearded man
drove rapidly down upon Pier No. 2, North River,
where the occupant emerged from the equipage, and,
elbowing his way through the throng, approached the
gangway of an immense steamer gaily decorated with
flags of all nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was stopped by two officials in uniform, one of
them saying civilly that no strangers were allowed on
board.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not this Mr. Morning’s steam yacht the <em>Patience</em>?”
said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, if the largest and finest vessel in the
world can be called a yacht. Certainly this is Mr.
Morning’s ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was told at the hotel that he would sail to-day for
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your information is quite correct; he goes as one
of the three delegates appointed by the President to
represent the United States at the Congress of Nations,
which will meet in Paris next month.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I want to see him before he sails,” replied
the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>“It is too late, sir, even if you had a card of admission.
His friends are now bidding good-by to the
bridal party, and in a few minutes the order will be
issued of ‘all ashore.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bridal party? Whose? Not Morning’s?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t you heard of it? Why, the papers have
been full of it for days. He was married yesterday,
in Boston, to the Baroness Von Eulaw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the stranger, “I only arrived this
morning from Arizona. I am the superintendent of
his mine there, and am here on business of importance.
He will be mightily disappointed if I don’t see him.
Suppose you send word to him that Bob Steel is here
and wants to see him before he sails. I reckon he’ll
give orders to admit me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The request of Steel was complied with, and directions
given for his admittance. After exchanging greetings
with Morning and being presented to the bride, Steel
stated that he had business of importance to communicate.
The whistle had sounded “all ashore,” and
the guests were rapidly departing. Morning quietly
instructed the captain not to have the lines cast off
until he should have finished his interview with Steel,
and then, summoning the latter to follow him into a
private salon, said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Bob, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Morning,” replied Steel, “the news ain’t
good, but it is so important I did not dare to trust
to mail or wire, so I left the mine in charge of Mr.
Fabian, and came on myself. We didn’t find no ore
last month on the new level at two hundred feet, and
I set three shifts to work at every station, and—I’m
afraid to tell you the result.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>“Out with it, Bob. I was married yesterday, and
you can’t tell me any news bad enough to hurt me
much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Mr. Morning, there ain’t no ore in the
mine below the one hundred and fifty feet level. <em>The
quartz has come to an end.</em> We are at the bed rock,
and the syenite is as solid and close-grained as the
basalt wall where we did our first work, you and I,
blasting with the Papago Indians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning whistled. “How much do we lack, Bob,
of the $2,400,000,000 I donated to the United States?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About eight hundred millions, sir; but there is
more than enough ore not stoped out in the upper
levels to pay that twice over. We have seventeen
hundred millions at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” said Morning, “will finish the payment

projected, give you ten millions, and all the men who

It will serve also to make some donations I have in

Morning family. It is not so much money now as it
was when I made the discovery, but it will keep the
wolf from the door. Bob, the whistles are sounding
and I shall have to bid you good-by and send you
ashore. There is no possibility, I suppose, of this being
only a break, or a horse? No chance of the ore

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
